"Constant ADs: banner ads, before, and after a game as well as whether or not you want extra items. Game functionality is good but the number buttons on the bottom are a bit too small and close together leading to incorrect inputs sometimes especially if you have long nails and likely an issue for larger fingers too. Game on its own is 4.5 stars but ads every other minute (especially if you solve the easier puzzles fast) are WAY too many. They should implement a timer so you can't have too many.",constant ad banner ad game well whether want extra item game functionality good number button bottom bit small close together leading incorrect input sometimes especially long nail likely issue larger finger game 45 star ad every minute especially solve easier puzzle fast way many implement timer cant many,0
"Great app. Levels are challenging. Easy levels are great for introducing people to the game. I enjoy the really puzzles. Extra features and pencil feature are smooth and easy to use. I'm not big on the events but that's just me. The ads can be a little annoying due to being given an ad after every level completion, hint, pause, resume, etc. Thankfully they are 5 seconds two or three times. It would be better if you were spared the ads if you solve a without any mistakes.",great app level challenging easy level great introducing people game enjoy really puzzle extra feature pencil feature smooth easy use im big event thats ad little annoying due given ad every level completion hint pause resume etc thankfully 5 second two three time would better spared ad solve without mistake,0
I play this game every day and have done so for years but the latest update is horrendous. The font size has been increased so much the screen is now cluttered and too noisy even on the smallest setting. The overall grid seems to be smaller than before with lots of dead space and excessively large numbers at the bottom. It is impossible to concentrate or see clearly with this dreadful update. The help centre does not seem to allow freestyle feedback. So disappointed.,play game every day done year latest update horrendous font size increased much screen cluttered noisy even smallest setting overall grid seems smaller lot dead space excessively large number bottom impossible concentrate see clearly dreadful update help centre seem allow freestyle feedback disappointed,0
"Tried this out as my previous app seemed to have played with how easy the puzzles were across the board. Difficulties here are OK but I keep accidentally clicking the auto fill button when I mean to click candidates, as the buttons look very similar. This takes me to an unskippable ad on each puzzle. Ads after every puzzle also get tiresome when event puzzles take about a minute each until you've unlocked the hard ones at lvl 50.

This game had grown to 4+ starz and a personal favorite. Then the side game 'Aquarius' reduced 5his to 3☆ rating with the addition of ads with.extended times. They cannot be broken. Then there are continuous loops to app store for loading new games that you are not interested. Then in loop between app store and game. This looping can last 2-3minutes. It is no longer my favorite. Rating go down to delete. This app is ridiculously easy games. Even their hints don't get beyond cross hatching.,game grown 4 starz personal favorite side game aquarius reduced 5his 3 rating addition ad withextended time cannot broken continuous loop app store loading new game interested loop app store game looping last 23minutes longer favorite rating go delete app ridiculously easy game even hint dont get beyond cross hatching,0
"The app interface is very good, but several times now, the app has given me an incorrect sudoku. To be a true sudoku, there can only be one solution, which is the premise for the ""unique rectangle"" solving technique. These incorrect puzzles end up with a rectangle of squares with exactly two candidates, the same candidates in each one. This is an impossible configuration for a puzzle with only one solution, and it forces you to guess which solution the developer intended. Please fix this ASAP",app interface good several time app given incorrect sudoku true sudoku one solution premise unique rectangle solving technique incorrect puzzle end rectangle square exactly two candidate candidate one impossible configuration puzzle one solution force guess solution developer intended please fix asap,0
"Get at your own risk! I uninstalled it and won't reinstall. At first, I loved it. I wasn't interested in sudoku before, but got hooked with this game. The reason for the bad review is because it randomly tried to give me a virus! I was putting a number in a box and I was suddenly redirected to a website claiming to be the security setting on my phone, notifying me of malware with a link to remove it. I, of course, immediately clicked OFF the website and promptly uninstalled.

"The ads are B.R.U.T.A.L. Everything else about the game is solid. But for every minute of play time, you will have about 2 minutes of ads. There are 2 ads between every round. I've never had such an ad intrusive game experience. And if you want to pay for ad free, it's $13/year. Not a one time fee. Per year. For Sudoku.

"I love Sudoku. That said, the number of ads in this game is beyond comprehension. Ad plays after each game, and if you have to pause a game, you'll have to watch an ad to go back to it. They offer an ad-free option at $12.99 yearly or $2.99 a month with unlimited hints and second chances. Wouldn't suggest wasting your time buying it.

"This is by far, one of the best sudoku games I have played. Plenty of choice for level, challenges etc. to add variety. Tried the 16 x 16 but couldn't hit the intended number as the squares are too small. I do however find it irritating that the Weekly win rate, doesn't not always recognise games as completed.

"I am very disappointed with your smaller board after the recent update. it looks like you try to kick out all senior users. 1) Those tiny wordings in the bottom are wasting our time & energy to go through it. The fun has been lost. 2) The ranking number had been changed to a piece of black diamond in each tournament. The changing makes the players lose their interest to join in.

"Okay so this game is really fun, and there are challenges where you can compete with other players by passing levels. I admit I don't understand the ranking system though. As I pass levels, my rank goes up which makes me think I'm passing all the other players who haven't quite made it to that level yet. However, whenever I reach the end of all the levels, I get rank 1. There's no way that I'm the first to reach the end every time. So how is the ranking system really determined?

"i love this gameSudoku is an amazing puzzle game that offers a perfect blend of challenge and relaxation. At first glance, it seems simple—a grid of 9x9 squares with a few numbers filled in, where the goal is to ensure every row, column, and 3x3 section contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.

There's a bug when you finish a daily puzzle or event and click a little bit too fast then the daily rewards just vanish pls fix it.

"Download any Sudoku app other than this one. The ads are terrible. Other apps offer the ""fast pencil"" option (when you want to ""pencil"" the possible numbers at the top of each square) for free - this one makes you view a 30-second ad, and THEN a 5-second interactive ad, and THEN a 2-second static ad.

"Excellent sudoku game! I love it! It could have two more sounds, one for when you have used a number (written 9 on the board) and another for when the auto complete appears.

"Pros: it is free, there are plenty of games and you can play offline, you can see some interesting stats.

"Hey gang, great Sudoku. Best I've tried. Can I make some suggestions? Number first mode should probably be default, that matches how most people solve the puzzles, the default cell first is tedious. Once a cell has the correct answer in it, the game accepts it. It's a bit silly that in number first mode you can accidentally tap the solved cell and create a mistake.

Good app to practice however the mistake function is a bit off. Some things should not be marked as mistakes if it is possible. This ruins the figuring it out part that users should be able to do later on and erase things. If both 1 and 6 could at that point in time go in a box let users figure out by trial and error rather than blatantly saying this one's the right one.,good app practice however mistake function bit thing marked mistake possible ruin figuring part user able later erase thing 1 6 could point time go box let user figure trial error rather blatantly saying one right one,0

Unfortunately my 1 stars is for excessive amounts of notifications. I'm talking at least 50 to 80 a day. I've paid for a years subscription I'm seriously considering a charge back. I've turned off notification even in the system and this app turns itself back on within a matter of hours. Do NOT PLAY. This app is phishing and manipulating the phones regardless of what we choose.,unfortunately 1 star excessive amount notification im talking least 50 80 day ive paid year subscription im seriously considering charge back ive turned notification even system app turn back within matter hour play app phishing manipulating phone regardless choose,1

"The game itself is fun and the different options keep you interested, HOWEVER, the constant ads are too much. There's an AD before and after every interaction. They say after 5 seconds you can X out of the Ads but that's not being honest (and also not accurate for every Ad). Most Ads after 5 seconds you can click an X however a new screen for the same AD shows up. Some, like candy crush, pinterest, or mistplay make you to click 3-5 Xs before closing completely and each X is a few seconds extra.",game fun different option keep interested however constant ad much there ad every interaction say 5 second x ad thats honest also accurate every ad ad 5 second click x however new screen ad show like candy crush pinterest mistplay make click 35 x closing completely x second extra,1

"Sooo many ads!! I don't often wrote reviews for apps but I am writing to express my frustration this time as this app annoyed me so much!
