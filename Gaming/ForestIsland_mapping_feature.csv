"I like what they're trying to do, but you have to watch lots of ads just to get anywhere. They are optional, but without them, you're left with nothing much to do. I'm especially annoyed with the events. The one we just had said it ended on 2/28/25, yet it is just past 8:00pm and the event has changed. I wish there had been a timer countdown instead so I knew when it would change over. I would have reached the end of the challenge had I known it wouldn't last until midnight. I'm so frustrated!","Review -> Ad Frequency, Event Scheduling, Timer Functionality, Challenge Duration"
"Great sfx, animations, and concept. Some camera angles aren't great, and no good way to move it. But I like the camera album reward system concept and the creature eggs. No forced ads which is nice. No way to buy the game though or subscribe. And when I tried to log in it glitched. Now it wont even load. I've tried all I can, but I have to uninstall and reinstall. If it continues to try and log me in to my ""saved yet corrupted"" progress, then I can't play.","Review -> Special Effects, Animations, Camera Angles, Camera Movement, Reward System, In-App Purchases, Subscription Model, Ad Display, Login Functionality, Progress Saving, Game Loading"
"Very cute and while ads are NECESSARY to progress, none of them are forced on you. I love supporting a game like this, and that's where my problem came in. There's a way to remove ads... for $45. I would pay that price for a complete version of this game, but there's a couple dozen large micro transactions after getting rid of ads. Edit: Gameplay does get tedious later on as they quickly require more output with significantly less input.","Review -> Ad Removal, Microtransactions, Gameplay, Monetization Model"
"Fun, but you quickly realize YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS without watching TONS of ads. 30-50 per day. sure they're ""voluntary""... but they're not voluntary if you want to progress. once you get the Rainforest, just uninstall, there's nothing more to obtain. took about a week. every single inch of this game is covered in opportunities for you to pay money. the animals are cute, but it's not a true idle game (doesn't progress while app is closed) and it really feels like a shameless cash grab.","Review -> Ad Frequency, Progression System, Idle Gameplay, In-App Purchases, Game Content"
"This game is wonderful! It is very soothing and is full of cute animals. However, I've recently came across a bug. When I tried to get some energy (So I could get closer to the raccoon area), it didn't work, I had tried purchasing the 12 hour energy package 4 or 5 times and got nothing in return. Please fix this bug.","Review -> Energy Purchase, Bug Fixing, In-Game Currency or Energy System"
"The game itself is very calming and relaxing. The problem with it though, is that the photos only print, and end up in the photo album about half the time. The other half, you take a photo and wait 10 minutes, only to find out it didn't save, because the camera feature in this game is seriously bugged. Probably gonna end up deleting the game because that glitch is so frustrating to deal with.","Review -> Camera Feature, Photo Saving/Album Feature, Overall Game Stability"
"Wish I could recommend higher. Fun, cute game. Leveling up requires watching many ads, and half the time ads fail to load and you have to sit through 1-2 min of a black screen over and over and not get your ad reward. (But it's a real ad bc if you tap the screen it pulls up a Google Play page for a game.) I just tried to get my ""heart dolphin x3"" reward 4 times and - nothing. If the ads don't load & still disable the whole game for 60 sec, we should still get the benefits!","Review -> Ad Loading, Ad Reward System, Game Performance, Reward Distribution"
"Seems some awards have unavoidable ads, which are quite annoying (dolphin heart for example) even when selecting the reward without the 5 times option, an ad pops up. other games I've played have never done this.

"I love this game. Ive been playing a about 6 months now and it's just so cute. I'm giving 4 stars because the ads can be way too much. Sometimes they are a minute long, and sometimes you have to click out of them 3 times before they go away. I wish this could be fixed but im sure it's those stupid app developers that make the ads.

"Cute, but I wish there weren't so many things to purchase. Kind of ruins the experience whenever you get a pop up for an animal you have to pay for. Can't the different patterns on the animals just be rare or something? Or Can't they have babies without you having to pay if you have a male and female?

"Really neat game and quite beautiful, definitely a game to play while trying to fall asleep to. Although I personally had some issues, I hope others don't have this same issue; the game will just, not let me use the egg feature after, zooming in on nothing. I used it once, and whenever I click off this invisible egg it disables the bottom boxes from getting clicked. Seperate from this was also the inability to call albatross, dolphins, or claim free items, rendering me unable to continue. GG tho","Review -> Egg Feature, Zoom Capability, User Interface, Item Claiming, Albatross and Dolphin Summoning"
"really beautiful game and I love the variety of animals and birds offered, but there are so many glitches! sometimes you watch ads for whole minutes and do not get the rewards (hearts/energy/foggy tokens) that were promised. also for the cherry blossom heart buff, I have never gotten the full ten minutes promised because it always glitches and takes a full minute or more off my allocated time (sometime in the last 5 minutes). ads are a lot, but glitches are worse!!","Review -> Ad Reward System, Glitch Handling, Cherry Blossom Heart Buff, Ad Frequency"
"Love this game, so cute. However the egg feature is broken. I know I'm not the first to say it but if we're all saying it's broken... Guys, fix it or something. Take it away even. I don't care about the eggs if they're causing too many dev problems. But anytime the majority of us click on the egg icon (usually accidentally) it freezes the whole game. Just fix it or remove it until it can be fixed. Thanks. 5 stars when you do â¤ï¸","Review -> Egg Feature, Game Stability, Crash/Freeze Issue"
"cute cookie clicker-style game. nice to pass the time. ads are mostly optional! optional 30sec ads to get extra rewards. only issue is the eggs which are currently game breaking. rubbed an egg and now it's disappeared and gone invisible and if I tap on the egg icon with the ! on it, it breaks my game so that I can't tap anything. hard closing the app fixes it but I shouldn't have to do that. hope it's fixed in an update soon!","Review -> Ad Management, Egg Feature, Game Stability"
"I love it so far. I caters to my grinding habits really well. And the concept and designs are really cute. My only nit pick is that it doesn't have a dark/night mode so it's really bright all the time. And the weather isn't manually set either so I can't have rain on 24/7. But other than that and some failed login attempts (just refresh the login screen and it usually works again), I'm enjoying it. 7.5/10","I love it so far. I caters to my grinding habits really well.

"Ads, ads, ads, ads,... unless if you pay for the tickets to skip ads... What my 1 star is for thoughs is since the new event update it keeps crashing before it fully loads, then once I get it loaded & go to watch an ad (you know, because it's like 85% ads, 10% money grab, & 5% a game). At first it didn't crash while playing, but now it's every single time I click an ad. You basically can not do anything in the game without having to watch ads... I tried un-/re-installing, still crashes.","Review -> Ad Frequency, Stability, Ad Handling, Installation/Uninstallation Process"

When I open the app, a white box comes up that on the top says ""LIAPP ALERT"" and below that says ""[1011] threat has been detected. app will be terminated."" that exactly. It makes me nervous... I can't tell if it's actually a threat or just some bizarre bug.

"It's a nice little game and since I got it yesterday, it's been fun. Yet, within a day it's very easy to tell that without watching ads you will get fundamentally nowhere. In-app purchases aren't required but are nearly shoved down your throat with how many there are. Progress stagmates rather quickly after a single day even when watching ads constantly. If ads were greatly decreased the game would be 100% better Edit: I'm not spending over 20 dollars to get rid of ads, your reply sucks","It's a nice little game and since I got it yesterday, it's been fun.

This game was an easy 5 star rating when I first started playing. Then it all came crashing down when the potentially game-breaking egg glitch happened to me. When tapping the egg I am unable to interact with the game until I hit the back button on the phone. Yet when I do this it pretty much breaks the game and I cannot tap anything. Even after an uninstall it is still unplayable. Tried to go to player support and it is all in Korean!

I downloaded this game last week and at first it seemed enjoyable. For the past 2 days each time I log in and try to watch an ad to move to the next step it plays the ad in full and then the app crashes and has to reload only to log back in and see that I didn't even get credit for watching the ad. I can no longer progress in the game and this is VERY frustrating because I believe the game is trying to FORCE me to buy the ad coupons. I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't spend $$,"Review -> Ad Watching Feature, In-App Purchases, Crash and Reload, Progression System"

"*PLEASE FIX EGGS* I really love this game but I'm betting driven mad by the glitch that is eggs currently. I hatched my first egg on the tutorial, went to hatch a second egg, rubbed it, and then it poofed. Completely disappeared. I can back out of the egg, and sometimes it means I lose the ability to tap anything else and have to restart the game. Other times, it will let me continue normal game play. But regardless, I'm unable to receive achievements for anything egg related.","*PLEASE FIX EGGS* -> Egg Hatching, Achievement System, Game Stability"

"Cute game, easy to play, relaxing, low # of ads, but one of the game features is broken. The eggs don't work. I opened one, but now even though it says there is an egg nothing shows up, I can't see it, and even worse if I accidentally click on that area once I zoom back out I can no longer collect items or do the photos, I have to quit and relaunch the game to have those things work again.

"I love the aesthetic of this game. My main problem with it, like every other mobile game, is the ads. They're too pervasive. What's more, instead of offering a one-time buy to stop ads like you get with most apps, you have to purchase ad tickets, which seem like they're only going to be good for one ad at a time. I refuse to skip ads like this. Another more minor problem, but major from a gameplay perspective, is that the egg has disappeared, and if I try to click where it's supposed to be, it just freezes my game. No matter how many times I close the app and come back, the egg is still not visible or interactable, and clicking its location or the icon for it in the lower left freezes my game again. Support for the game is not available in English, and I don't know... Korean, maybe? As I said from the start, I love the aesthetic of this game. If a low-priced one-and-done option to skip ads existed, I'd buy it. Hell, if it was a one-month ad-skip ticket, I'd probably buy it if it was inexpensive. But until these two issues are fixed, I can't recommend it to anyone who would have problems with broken content or an expensive ad-skip monetization system.","Review -> Ad Management, Gameplay Stability, Customer Support, In-App Purchases, User Interface"
"Again, would be full stars, but now there's a issue with the reward ads. The game has a ton of ads to watch in return for stuff, but I can only load two or three before the game stops being able to load more, causing me to reload my game every couple minutes just to make the ads work again. I'm at a point where the game is progressing painfully slow so I kinda need to be able to speed watch these ads in order to get anywhere.

"It's a cute little idle game, but there's ads on almost everything. I get it, and I didn't have a problem with it until after a few days of playing. They're for bonuses, but it's ad after ad after ad. More time spent watching ads than actually playing the game. I WANT to love this game, but I'm not going to spend my extra time watching ads. At least add a purchasable store item that removes them, because I'd absolutely buy that in order to not bloat my playtime with misleading, annoying ads.","Review -> Ad Frequency, In-Game Purchases, Ad Removal Option"
"I can't rate it more than 2 stars. The gameplay is ok, but it puts purchase buttons right behind regular buttons like the ""OK"" button to proceed into the game. Basically, if you press ""OK"" more than once you will inevitably press the purchase button for some random item pack that puts you on the Google Play transaction menu to purchase it. It does this in other places as well. It wasn't as much of an issue until one of the recent updates. I rarely write reviews, but this app needed this one.","Review -> In-Game Purchases, User Interface, Button Placement, Transaction Process"
"I cannot support any game that sells ""ad coupons."" To do anything productive you gotta watch 30 second ads every... 30 seconds. Instead of selling a ""remove ads"" package like other games, they sell ""ad coupons"" which basically let you skip one ad at the cost of (usually multiple) coupons. So, if you wanna permanently remove ads, you need to keep dumping money into this game. You could easily spend $20-40 *per day* just removing ads. Absolutely disgraceful. I'd give negative stars if possible.","Review -> Ad Removal System, In-Game Purchases, Ad Frequency"
"Nice little game but unfortunately has tons of microtransactions, just the bundles alone cost ~$170 total. Also, ads are not working at all for me, meaning that my quest progress is hard locked since you need to watch an ad to perform a certain quest task.

"Game requires you to watch ridiculous amounts of ads. You want to level up? You have to call a flock of birds five times... every single time means watching a 30 second ad. There is no way around it except to purchase ""ad coupons"" with real-world money. You can't even buy a permanent way out of the ads. They want $3.00 for 50 ad skips.

The customer contact/help page is only in korean. 4. You move your finger across half an inch of phone screen, you zoom 5 miles in that direction like the flash.

"I quite enjoyed this game when it first came out, but it quickly just became boring. Progress doesnt happen pretty much at all at a point without spending money or nonstop ads. The thing that threw me off the most is the money grab event pass, spend money for better rewards that half the prizes probably disappear once its over. 50/50 on the app opening first try or just staying blackscreen, I feel the game would be amazing if they developers didn't become money hungry and fixed problems.","Review -> Progression System, In-App Purchases, Ad Frequency, Event Pass, App Stability"
"I'm new to this game and I'm enjoying it so far in general but I am a little frustrated by a bug in which the egg sort of dissapears?

Additionally, once I've clicked on the egg and I go back to the rest of my island, all of the buttons on the side and bottom become unresponsive unless I restart the game.

No matter how many times I do these steps, it still forces an ad and there is no going around it.

"I love this game. I enjoy expanding the island when unlocking other areas, with the animals habitats. One feature that I would like added to the game. A pause button so if I see an animal doing say like a seal bouncing the ball, while another animal in another habitat area is doing something else.

"I've played regularly for 18 days now. Growth level 11. Writing this review because I've hit a pretty big downtime in gameplay. ---####--- In summary, the game is very cute, it's a well-balanced idler with two currencies that interact well with each other. There is interesting gameplay interaction between the growth, achievements, level-ups, and especially the quests. The ads are not exactly required early on, but much needed if you don't want to advance at a snail's pace. They become obligated once the quests require them. ---####--- Gameplay: Cozy, not stressful. The animals interact a bit with the environment, but not with you. Do your little things around the island for about 10 minutes here and there throughout the day. The quest is the most fun element, making you somewhat plan ahead. The points they give you allow some player agency in how to grow their talents. It's fun to optimize energy and heart gains and quests with gameplay elements like photo or blossoms. The egg ""lootbox"" requires some luck but it's not very punishing, although the +% production birds are the clear desired items. The quests are not based on luck at all, which assures a steady progression. I've watched a ton of ads through this game however, to be allowed to progress. ---####--- My current situation, and complaint, is how the heart generation curve did not keep up with the quests or energy generation, which makes it unbalanced. I'm 18 days in, got great bird luck at 35, growth level 11. I've been doing quests as fast as I could. I reached level 75 of the Cloud Hills through energy before even being able to buy a single Sheep for 10.00f heart, which is my current quest. I'm getting pitiful amounts of heart through all the possible sources: blossoms give 0.15f, dolphins give 0.04f, 1h tickets give 0.14f, 150min of otter give 0.45f at 3x. ---####--- This step will take me about 3-4 full days to complete, which is the longest I've been without completing any quest. The devs should be wary of such a stagnant part of gameplay, which has already been pretty much the same since the Deer Meadow, or since the egg and photo additions. ---####--- It's fun to do these tiny tasks, although it gets repetitive and the rewarding gameplay took a huge halt around hearts for the sheep. I got super lucky on birds and watched all the ads I could. I'm dreading the time it will take me to obtain all the hearts for the next animal. This huge gap in quest completion has sadly eroded my interest, what felt like a fun game might start feeling like a chore now.","Review -> Gameplay Balance, Currency System, Advertisements, Quests, Energy Generation, Heart Generation, Lootbox System, Progression Curve, Replay Value, User Engagement"
