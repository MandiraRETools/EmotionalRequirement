"I like what they're trying to do, but you have to watch lots of ads just to get anywhere. They are optional, but without them, you're left with nothing much to do. I'm especially annoyed with the events. The one we just had said it ended on 2/28/25, yet it is just past 8:00pm and the event has changed. I wish there had been a timer countdown instead so I knew when it would change over. I would have reached the end of the challenge had I known it wouldn't last until midnight. I'm so frustrated!","Ad Frequency, Event Scheduling, Timer Functionality, Challenge Duration",Negative
"Great sfx, animations, and concept. Some camera angles aren't great, and no good way to move it. But I like the camera album reward system concept and the creature eggs. No forced ads which is nice. No way to buy the game though or subscribe. And when I tried to log in it glitched. Now it wont even load. I've tried all I can, but I have to uninstall and reinstall. If it continues to try and log me in to my ""saved yet corrupted"" progress, then I can't play.","Special Effects, Animations, Camera Angles, Camera Movement, Reward System, In-App Purchases, Subscription Model, Ad Display, Login Functionality, Progress Saving, Game Loading",Positive
"Very cute and while ads are NECESSARY to progress, none of them are forced on you. I love supporting a game like this, and that's where my problem came in. There's a way to remove ads... for $45. I would pay that price for a complete version of this game, but there's a couple dozen large micro transactions after getting rid of ads. Edit: Gameplay does get tedious later on as they quickly require more output with significantly less input.","Ad Removal, Microtransactions, Gameplay, Monetization Model",Positive
"Fun, but you quickly realize YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS without watching TONS of ads. 30-50 per day. sure they're ""voluntary""... but they're not voluntary if you want to progress. once you get the Rainforest, just uninstall, there's nothing more to obtain. took about a week. every single inch of this game is covered in opportunities for you to pay money. the animals are cute, but it's not a true idle game (doesn't progress while app is closed) and it really feels like a shameless cash grab.","Ad Frequency, Progression System, Idle Gameplay, In-App Purchases, Game Content",Positive
"This game is wonderful! It is very soothing and is full of cute animals. However, I've recently came across a bug. When I tried to get some energy (So I could get closer to the raccoon area), it didn't work, I had tried purchasing the 12 hour energy package 4 or 5 times and got nothing in return. Please fix this bug.","Energy Purchase, Bug Fixing, In-Game Currency or Energy System",Positive
"The game itself is very calming and relaxing. The problem with it though, is that the photos only print, and end up in the photo album about half the time. The other half, you take a photo and wait 10 minutes, only to find out it didn't save, because the camera feature in this game is seriously bugged. Probably gonna end up deleting the game because that glitch is so frustrating to deal with.","Camera Feature, Photo Saving/Album Feature, Overall Game Stability",Negative
"Wish I could recommend higher. Fun, cute game. Leveling up requires watching many ads, and half the time ads fail to load and you have to sit through 1-2 min of a black screen over and over and not get your ad reward. (But it's a real ad bc if you tap the screen it pulls up a Google Play page for a game.) I just tried to get my ""heart dolphin x3"" reward 4 times and - nothing. If the ads don't load & still disable the whole game for 60 sec, we should still get the benefits!","Ad Loading, Ad Reward System, Game Performance, Reward Distribution",Positive
"Seems some awards have unavoidable ads, which are quite annoying (dolphin heart for example) even when selecting the reward without the 5 times option, an ad pops up. other games I've played have never done this. Deleted game, unavoidable ads ruin the game, and I don't want to pay about $25 to avoid 500 ads just so later they come back, that's weird, ads ads ads annoying","Ad Frequency, In-App Purchases, Reward System",Positive
"I love this game. Ive been playing a about 6 months now and it's just so cute. I'm giving 4 stars because the ads can be way too much. Sometimes they are a minute long, and sometimes you have to click out of them 3 times before they go away. I wish this could be fixed but im sure it's those stupid app developers that make the ads. ""Oh let's make them close out of the ad 3 times before it goes away. That will make them want to download our app that is nothing like how the ad portrays it to be""."," Ad Frequency, Ad Duration, Ad Dismissal Process",Positive
"Cute, but I wish there weren't so many things to purchase. Kind of ruins the experience whenever you get a pop up for an animal you have to pay for. Can't the different patterns on the animals just be rare or something? Or Can't they have babies without you having to pay if you have a male and female? Please, just put the paid-for animals on one singular button, Im tired of trying to navigate my island and accidentally clicking on a purchase.","In-App Purchases, Animal Customization, Breeding System, User Interface, Navigation",Negative
"Really neat game and quite beautiful, definitely a game to play while trying to fall asleep to. Although I personally had some issues, I hope others don't have this same issue; the game will just, not let me use the egg feature after, zooming in on nothing. I used it once, and whenever I click off this invisible egg it disables the bottom boxes from getting clicked. Seperate from this was also the inability to call albatross, dolphins, or claim free items, rendering me unable to continue. GG tho","Egg Feature, Zoom Capability, User Interface, Item Claiming, Albatross and Dolphin Summoning",Positive
"really beautiful game and I love the variety of animals and birds offered, but there are so many glitches! sometimes you watch ads for whole minutes and do not get the rewards (hearts/energy/foggy tokens) that were promised. also for the cherry blossom heart buff, I have never gotten the full ten minutes promised because it always glitches and takes a full minute or more off my allocated time (sometime in the last 5 minutes). ads are a lot, but glitches are worse!!","Ad Reward System, Glitch Handling, Cherry Blossom Heart Buff, Ad Frequency",Positive
"Love this game, so cute. However the egg feature is broken. I know I'm not the first to say it but if we're all saying it's broken... Guys, fix it or something. Take it away even. I don't care about the eggs if they're causing too many dev problems. But anytime the majority of us click on the egg icon (usually accidentally) it freezes the whole game. Just fix it or remove it until it can be fixed. Thanks. 5 stars when you do Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â","Egg Feature, Game Stability, Crash/Freeze Issue",Negative
"cute cookie clicker-style game. nice to pass the time. ads are mostly optional! optional 30sec ads to get extra rewards. only issue is the eggs which are currently game breaking. rubbed an egg and now it's disappeared and gone invisible and if I tap on the egg icon with the ! on it, it breaks my game so that I can't tap anything. hard closing the app fixes it but I shouldn't have to do that. hope it's fixed in an update soon!","Ad Management, Egg Feature, Game Stability",Positive
"I love it so far. I caters to my grinding habits really well. And the concept and designs are really cute. My only nit pick is that it doesn't have a dark/night mode so it's really bright all the time. And the weather isn't manually set either so I can't have rain on 24/7. But other than that and some failed login attempts (just refresh the login screen and it usually works again), I'm enjoying it. 7.5/10","User Interface, Customization, Login Functionality, Display Settings, Weather Control",Positive
"Ads, ads, ads, ads,... unless if you pay for the tickets to skip ads... What my 1 star is for thoughs is since the new event update it keeps crashing before it fully loads, then once I get it loaded & go to watch an ad (you know, because it's like 85% ads, 10% money grab, & 5% a game). At first it didn't crash while playing, but now it's every single time I click an ad. You basically can not do anything in the game without having to watch ads... I tried un-/re-installing, still crashes.","Ad Frequency, Stability, Ad Handling, Installation/Uninstallation Process",Positive
"I just made a review on this and accidentally deleted it. When I open the app, a white box comes up that on the top says ""LIAPP ALERT"" and below that says ""[1011] threat has been detected. app will be terminated."" that exactly. It makes me nervous... I can't tell if it's actually a threat or just some bizarre bug. When I click the green ""OK"" button, it just closes the app and sends me to my home menu.","Error Handling, Stability, Security, User Interface",Negative
"It's a nice little game and since I got it yesterday, it's been fun. Yet, within a day it's very easy to tell that without watching ads you will get fundamentally nowhere. In-app purchases aren't required but are nearly shoved down your throat with how many there are. Progress stagmates rather quickly after a single day even when watching ads constantly. If ads were greatly decreased the game would be 100% better Edit: I'm not spending over 20 dollars to get rid of ads, your reply sucks","Ad Frequency, In-app Purchases, Progression System, Monetization Model",Positive
This game was an easy 5 star rating when I first started playing. Then it all came crashing down when the potentially game-breaking egg glitch happened to me. When tapping the egg I am unable to interact with the game until I hit the back button on the phone. Yet when I do this it pretty much breaks the game and I cannot tap anything. Even after an uninstall it is still unplayable. Tried to go to player support and it is all in Korean! Fix this and the rating goes back to 5 stars.,"Egg Interaction, Game Stability, Customer Support, Uninstall/Reinstall Functionality, Touch/Input Responsiveness",Positive
I downloaded this game last week and at first it seemed enjoyable. For the past 2 days each time I log in and try to watch an ad to move to the next step it plays the ad in full and then the app crashes and has to reload only to log back in and see that I didn't even get credit for watching the ad. I can no longer progress in the game and this is VERY frustrating because I believe the game is trying to FORCE me to buy the ad coupons. I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't spend $$,"Ad Watching Feature, In-App Purchases, Crash and Reload, Progression System",Negative
It's an amazing app. but I've had an issue. I visited someone's island and I tried to go back to mine but the only thing I get is the title and nothing else. Please fix this soon! This also just started when the new update came. I can't move the screen and things won't work. Have a nice day and please fix this very soon! I've would've rated this a five star but it's just a four because of this. Hope you see this issue. Goodbye!,"Navigation, Screen Movement, Update Installation",Positive
"*PLEASE FIX EGGS* I really love this game but I'm betting driven mad by the glitch that is eggs currently. I hatched my first egg on the tutorial, went to hatch a second egg, rubbed it, and then it poofed. Completely disappeared. I can back out of the egg, and sometimes it means I lose the ability to tap anything else and have to restart the game. Other times, it will let me continue normal game play. But regardless, I'm unable to receive achievements for anything egg related.","Egg Hatching, Achievement System, Game Stability",Negative
"Help! I will change my review if this gets figured out! I just downloaded the game and it isn't working right! I think it's stuck on a part in the tutorial. It said get the tree to level 5-did it. Then it said level up the tree to level 10 and fully restore the tree of life- I went above and beyond level five and (level 48, in fact) and tapped everywhere on screen and it isn't doing anything or opening any screens/menu! I tried closing the game and reopening, made sure it was updated etc.","Tutorial Mode, Game Progression, User Interface, Menu Navigation, Game Updates",Positive
"Cute game, LOVE IT! Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Problem I have, is that I use my phone stylus pen for this types of games. I'm unable to use it while moving/rotating the screen or tapping on animals to pick-up coins, hearts, & diamonds, yet I can use it while tapping to upgrade: locations, animals, & purchases, &or take pictures; etc. I hope the next update will change that? I know this may seem unnecessary but for me it's easier to use a stylus pen than your hand/indexfinger. Fix that & I'll rate it a 5 star!","Stylus Compatibility, Screen Rotation, Touch Input, Coin Collection, Animal Interaction, Upgrade Mechanism, User Interface",Positive
"Cute game, easy to play, relaxing, low # of ads, but one of the game features is broken. The eggs don't work. I opened one, but now even though it says there is an egg nothing shows up, I can't see it, and even worse if I accidentally click on that area once I zoom back out I can no longer collect items or do the photos, I have to quit and relaunch the game to have those things work again. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling only to have same experience so I'm uninstalling permanently.","Egg Feature, Ad Frequency, Game Stability, Item Collection, Photo Feature, Zoom Functionality",Negative
"I love the aesthetic of this game. My main problem with it, like every other mobile game, is the ads. They're too pervasive. What's more, instead of offering a one-time buy to stop ads like you get with most apps, you have to purchase ad tickets, which seem like they're only going to be good for one ad at a time. I refuse to skip ads like this. Another more minor problem, but major from a gameplay perspective, is that the egg has disappeared, and if I try to click where it's supposed to be, it just freezes my game. No matter how many times I close the app and come back, the egg is still not visible or interactable, and clicking its location or the icon for it in the lower left freezes my game again. Support for the game is not available in English, and I don't know... Korean, maybe? As I said from the start, I love the aesthetic of this game. If a low-priced one-and-done option to skip ads existed, I'd buy it. Hell, if it was a one-month ad-skip ticket, I'd probably buy it if it was inexpensive. But until these two issues are fixed, I can't recommend it to anyone who would have problems with broken content or an expensive ad-skip monetization system.","Ad Management, Gameplay Stability, Customer Support, In-App Purchases, User Interface",Negative
"Again, would be full stars, but now there's a issue with the reward ads. The game has a ton of ads to watch in return for stuff, but I can only load two or three before the game stops being able to load more, causing me to reload my game every couple minutes just to make the ads work again. I'm at a point where the game is progressing painfully slow so I kinda need to be able to speed watch these ads in order to get anywhere. OTHERWISE lovely game.","Ad Loading, Ad Frequency, Game Progression, Overall Performance",Positive
"It's a cute little idle game, but there's ads on almost everything. I get it, and I didn't have a problem with it until after a few days of playing. They're for bonuses, but it's ad after ad after ad. More time spent watching ads than actually playing the game. I WANT to love this game, but I'm not going to spend my extra time watching ads. At least add a purchasable store item that removes them, because I'd absolutely buy that in order to not bloat my playtime with misleading, annoying ads.","Ad Frequency, In-Game Purchases, Ad Removal Option",Positive
"I can't rate it more than 2 stars. The gameplay is ok, but it puts purchase buttons right behind regular buttons like the ""OK"" button to proceed into the game. Basically, if you press ""OK"" more than once you will inevitably press the purchase button for some random item pack that puts you on the Google Play transaction menu to purchase it. It does this in other places as well. It wasn't as much of an issue until one of the recent updates. I rarely write reviews, but this app needed this one.","In-Game Purchases, User Interface, Button Placement, Transaction Process",Positive
"I cannot support any game that sells ""ad coupons."" To do anything productive you gotta watch 30 second ads every... 30 seconds. Instead of selling a ""remove ads"" package like other games, they sell ""ad coupons"" which basically let you skip one ad at the cost of (usually multiple) coupons. So, if you wanna permanently remove ads, you need to keep dumping money into this game. You could easily spend $20-40 *per day* just removing ads. Absolutely disgraceful. I'd give negative stars if possible.","Ad Removal System, In-Game Purchases, Ad Frequency",Negative
"Nice little game but unfortunately has tons of microtransactions, just the bundles alone cost ~$170 total. Also, ads are not working at all for me, meaning that my quest progress is hard locked since you need to watch an ad to perform a certain quest task. Have been stuck like this for a few days and I can def feel that my progress has been pretty slow without the upgrades you get from the quests. Shame since it's a nice little game.","Microtransactions, Ad Functionality, Quest Progression, Upgrade System",Positive
"Game requires you to watch ridiculous amounts of ads. You want to level up? You have to call a flock of birds five times... every single time means watching a 30 second ad. There is no way around it except to purchase ""ad coupons"" with real-world money. You can't even buy a permanent way out of the ads. They want $3.00 for 50 ad skips. They hide so much content behind this ad wall that you can easily run through that in a few hours. 0/10, would not recommend (unless you LOVE watching ads).","Ad Frequency, In-App Purchases, Ad Removal Options, Content Accessibility, Monetization Model",Positive
"My original review was deleted. This app has potential BUT: 1. It stopped loading ads, so I couldn't get through many aspects of the game. 2. It takes 5 minutes or longer to load. 3. The customer contact/help page is only in korean. 4. You move your finger across half an inch of phone screen, you zoom 5 miles in that direction like the flash. Calmly zooming in and panning across the island is strangely difficult. Touch sensitivity needs work. If they ever debug, it might be cute and relaxing","Ad Loading, Loading Time, Customer Support, Touch Sensitivity, Zooming and Panning",Positive
"I quite enjoyed this game when it first came out, but it quickly just became boring. Progress doesnt happen pretty much at all at a point without spending money or nonstop ads. The thing that threw me off the most is the money grab event pass, spend money for better rewards that half the prizes probably disappear once its over. 50/50 on the app opening first try or just staying blackscreen, I feel the game would be amazing if they developers didn't become money hungry and fixed problems.","Progression System, In-App Purchases, Ad Frequency, Event Pass, App Stability",Positive
"I'm new to this game and I'm enjoying it so far in general but I am a little frustrated by a bug in which the egg sort of dissapears? Once I click the egg icon it is invisible and therefore unhatchable. Additionally, once I've clicked on the egg and I go back to the rest of my island, all of the buttons on the side and bottom become unresponsive unless I restart the game. I can still gather hearts and energy from the island but I can't upgrade anything or look at offers or take photos.","Egg Hatching Mechanism, User Interface Responsiveness, Button Functionality",Positive
"I pre-registered and this game is AMAZING!! I would give it a 5 star, until the glitch I found is fixed. The glitch is the menu, after a certain amount of time spent in the game playing. The menu to upgrade your unlocked lands kind of dissappers. You can't buy anymore animals because that button is off screen, or upgrade the lands by finger manually. You have to tap the arrow to actually upgrade the lands you unlocked. If you could please, fix this small bug with the menu?","Menu Navigation, User Interface, Upgrade Functionality, Land Management",Positive
"Over HALF of the buttons are ads. Beautiful but useless. 3 ads in the water. 2/3 island had permanent ads in the middle, negating even utilizing their 'relaxing zone (way too zoomed in, no controls, no interaction zone). Ad in the top left, ads to the top right. Ads that popped up after I upgraded something? My apologies to the artist, it is such a shame. The EXCESSIVE ad space makes it more like a big city highway than a mental escape. Let us know if you fix that, pleaseÃ¢ÂÂ¡","Ad Placement, User Interface, Relaxation Zone, Interaction Zone, Customization, Upgrade System, Ad Frequency",Positive
"Forced ads. After being offline, if I collect rewards and choose not to see ad for double rewards, I get an ad in next 2 seconds. Closed the game not to see the ad, reopen, same problem. No matter how many times I do these steps, it still forces an ad and there is no going around it. After 6-7 times I uninstalled because chosing not to see an ad should let me continue without one. 1 STAR for forcing an ad every time after just 5 sec inside the game and after just choosing not to watch one.","Ad Frequency, Reward System, Gameplay Interruption",Negative
"Could've been good, but after a day or so you'll start getting ads much more frequently with no way to permanently remove them. You can only buy ""ad tickets"" which allow you to skip one ad per ticket. You'd have to keep buying these over and over. One day a dev will learn that money can be made without being predatory. Don't buy the frogs, don't buy the ducks, don't buy anything because the micro transaction pushing never stops, ruining what could be an actual helpful game.","Ad Frequency, In-App Purchases, Microtransactions, Ad Removal Options",Positive
"Lots of detail and great art but probably the greediest devs I've ever seen, constantly pushing ads and paid content, the ads get worse as the game progresses, it started out with 15 and 30 second adds and progressed to being 1-2 mins with no timer showing, also the further you get in the game the more ads are required to progress, with late game upgrades taking over 1000 ads","In-Game Advertising, Monetization Model, Game Progression, Upgrade System",Negative
"I can't watch ads. They are unavailable and won't load, there are only grey buttons and neverending loading animation. Because of that I can't get gems, pearls, tokens, chests, task rerolls, eggs, rare animals, and other things crucial for the full game experience. I don't use any VPN or ad blockers. Either developers or Google decided to give me and my compatriots a middle finger. Very relaxing, thanks.","Ad Loading, Ad Availability, In-Game Rewards, User Interface, Virtual Currency",Positive
"Game is starting to become pay to ""win"". I understand the need to get money, but you can't obtain all the new animals from the monthly passes and events unless you pay for them. That makes it impossible to collect every animal as a f2p player, as a ""completionist and collectionist"" I'm tired of having everything behind a paywall. I loved this game and I supported it by buying 2 animal bundles & watching ads myself, but I'm not doing any of that anymore if this keeps happening on future events.","Monetization Model, Accessibility of In-Game Content, Event Rewards, Purchase Options",Positive
"This game is endless which means you can never get bored while playing it. It has interactive graphics, relaxing sounds, and reminds you of the beauty of nature. However, you can't play the game at the same time with two devices and the same email account which is sad when my daughters want to play it at the same time in a different location. Overall, this game is good, so I want to give it a 4.5 star rating, but since that isn't possible, I estimated 4.5 into 5 stars. This game is a must try.","Endless Gameplay, Interactive Graphics, Relaxing Sounds, Multi-Device Support, Email Account Management",Positive
"Game was cute for the first 2 hours I played it. I first opened it using the ""guest"" option, since I didn't want to make an account yet. I tried creating one later, but was given a ""failed log-in"" error. After exiting and attempting to re-open, I was repetitively met with a glitched ""invalid user ID"" error, locking me out permanently. Other than this, the game plagues you with ad pushes, with permanent exclamation marks to get your attention. Agonising for my OCD/ASD and left me stressed.","Account Creation, Login Functionality, Ad Management, User Interface, Error Handling",Negative
"I read a commernt here a while ago about someone being annoyed about the albatros and how you have to watch ads to play once you get to a certain level. They were unfortunately right. Once you hit a certain point, the only way to unlock new things fast enough is by calling the albatross multiple times a day and watching ads. So playing this game ends up being a system of logging in and just watching continuous ads to level up. Not a fan of this and it ruins a game that has a lot of potential.","In-Game Advertising, Progression System, Monetization Model",Negative

"Egregious gatcha game. The part that made me instantly give 1 star is the fact that it will sometimes throw you into an ad for opening a ""free"" chest. Some free chests make you watch an ad, but they are clearly labeled. Edit: found an even worse problem. Whenever I purchase a time ticket, it will spend the gems but I will not receive my recources.

"Game is really nice, but almost every ""premium"" action requires watching ads, and the game system strongly encourages you to use them. That's not the problem. The price is. To remove ads, you need to buy the tiered whale package. Tier 1 gives 5 ad skips/day and costs $8. T2 gives 15 skips/day and costs $15. Only T3 removes all ads, and costs $22.

A pretty little sandbox/collection game ruined by it's dedication to ads. Ad-locked content is everywhere and there are no micro purchases that allow you to just skip ads permanently. Instead the various packages have a number of ad-skip tickets that will eventually run out and require you to purchase again. Even the most insane package (a ÃÂ£30 a month renewing subscription) only allows you to skip 10 ads a day!,"Ad Management, In-App Purchases, Subscription Model",Negative

Also, have the couple of swans swim separately/naturally and come together when the hearts are ready to be collected.

"I've played regularly for 18 days now. Growth level 11. Writing this review because I've hit a pretty big downtime in gameplay. ---####--- In summary, the game is very cute, it's a well-balanced idler with two currencies that interact well with each other. There is interesting gameplay interaction between the growth, achievements, level-ups, and especially the quests. The ads are not exactly required early on, but much needed if you don't want to advance at a snail's pace. They become obligated once the quests require them. ---####--- Gameplay: Cozy, not stressful. The animals interact a bit with the environment, but not with you. Do your little things around the island for about 10 minutes here and there throughout the day. The quest is the most fun element, making you somewhat plan ahead. The points they give you allow some player agency in how to grow their talents. It's fun to optimize energy and heart gains and quests with gameplay elements like photo or blossoms. The egg ""lootbox"" requires some luck but it's not very punishing, although the +% production birds are the clear desired items. The quests are not based on luck at all, which assures a steady progression. I've watched a ton of ads through this game however, to be allowed to progress. ---####--- My current situation, and complaint, is how the heart generation curve did not keep up with the quests or energy generation, which makes it unbalanced. I'm 18 days in, got great bird luck at 35, growth level 11. I've been doing quests as fast as I could. I reached level 75 of the Cloud Hills through energy before even being able to buy a single Sheep for 10.00f heart, which is my current quest. I'm getting pitiful amounts of heart through all the possible sources: blossoms give 0.15f, dolphins give 0.04f, 1h tickets give 0.14f, 150min of otter give 0.45f at 3x. ---####--- This step will take me about 3-4 full days to complete, which is the longest I've been without completing any quest. The devs should be wary of such a stagnant part of gameplay, which has already been pretty much the same since the Deer Meadow, or since the egg and photo additions. ---####--- It's fun to do these tiny tasks, although it gets repetitive and the rewarding gameplay took a huge halt around hearts for the sheep. I got super lucky on birds and watched all the ads I could. I'm dreading the time it will take me to obtain all the hearts for the next animal. This huge gap in quest completion has sadly eroded my interest, what felt like a fun game might start feeling like a chore now.","Gameplay Balance, Currency System, Advertisements, Quests, Energy Generation, Heart Generation, Lootbox System, Progression Curve, Replay Value, User Engagement",Positive

I play this game every day and have done so for years but the latest update is horrendous. The font size has been increased so much the screen is now cluttered and too noisy even on the smallest setting. The overall grid seems to be smaller than before with lots of dead space and excessively large numbers at the bottom. It is impossible to concentrate or see clearly with this dreadful update.

Difficulties here are OK but I keep accidentally clicking the auto fill button when I mean to click candidates, as the buttons look very similar. This takes me to an unskippable ad on each puzzle.

Please guys, great app but please please limit the overall *frequency* of ads for people playing short games. Note the ad-free subscription is nearly half the price of a basic Netflix package...","Ad-free subscription, Ads frequency

"Great game to pass the time with daily challenges, frequent events and variety of difficulty normal games but the ads are getting crazy. Start and end of every game plus some automatically open the play store. As other have said, if you're playing quick games the ads can be double the time spent playing with some ads up to a minute long each. Don't mind some ads but please try limit it to a reasonable amount.","Daily Challenges, Variety of difficulty levels (Four Difficulty Levels)",Positive
"App functions but the number of ads are untenable. Some (most) ads must be clicked out of 5 times with long waits before the cross appears so you can click it and the ""hit box"" of the cross is miniscule and the area around it takes you to the play store to download it and frequently the ads become uncloseable as a result: requiring restarting the app, which in turn brings new ads. Ads are also very loud with no option to mute before they start and they pause any music you're listening to. Awful.","No Mapped Features (The review talks about ads, which is not a feature of the Sudoku game itself, but rather a monetization aspect)",Negative
"This app is cancerous now... It has so many intrusive, unskippable 30 second ad videos and forces you to click links that take you out of app. Response to dev: many are not skippable. And I have no problem with ads, the amount and type used to be perfectly acceptable. That has changed recently to loud, obnoxious, disruptive, unacceptably frequent ads which I would deem crosses a line into maliciously exploitive adware that tricks you into clicking on unwanted links. Hence, cancerous.",No Mapped Features,Positive
"I've enjoyed this for a while, and I don't usually care about advertising etc. But it has blown up and forcing me to get ""free gifts"" that I don't want or need and I hav to watch a vid to open the app, get the gift in don't want then again just to start playing one game. Then again when the game is done, then again for a gift I don't want... I spend 10 minutes on vids and get 2min of actual play time. If you can't afford to put out the app without doing that, get rid of it! Not worthwhile.","Daily Challenges, Play Sudoku Offline or Online",Positive

Because although I love the game, the developers really need to fix the ad banner situation. When I open the game, there's an ad on the banner that's literally spam and probably phishing, and that's always the one that shows up. Control the ads that show up in your game guys.

"I love Avatar World and was excited about the new multiplayer update. However, I faced a big issue. When I hosted a multiplayer world with my sister, we decorated and built many things. But when I accidentally quit the game and re-hosted, the entire world reset, and all our progress was gone. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very frustrating that multiplayer worlds donÃ¢ÂÂt seem to save when the host leaves.
