Review,Feature
"I played toca life since 2018 and Avatar world is one of the best games I played in my life there are a whole lot of places to visit and I don't have to pay a single cent to get all of those places, every single while they add new and fun stuff, and there are free gifts every single thing comes out!!! Big gifts,to be exact! When there is an event that comes out, there are big boxes with DECORATIONS , and cars,something that toca world dosent have. Overall. This gam is great. FIVE STARS!!!","Review -> Free-to-Play, Regular Updates, Gift System, Event Features, Customization Options, Exploration, Variety of Locations, Decorations, Virtual Items"
"Full transparency, I'm a 17 year old who grew up with Toca World. This app is 1,000x better. It has a cute artstyle, fun little mini games, and a whole world to explore, without spending a penny. It also has hidden items and puzzles, and, no joke, I will spend HOURS figuring them out. There are some that I haven't managed to get yet. They update regularly, have free holiday stuff, and way more to do than any other game I've tried like this. Keep up the good work!!","Review -> Art Style, Mini Games, Exploration, Hidden Items, Puzzles, Regular Updates, Free Content, Customization, Quests"
"Totally amazing! My daughter and I absolutely LOVE this game!! There's a TON of super cool FREE locations and items with fun animations, as well as a paid monthly pass that adds even more at a great price/value! They're really quick to fix bugs, and keep updating the game experience in a very positive way. I'm so impressed! I'd originally thought it was simply a Toca Boca World clone (it's not), but it surpasses as far as bug fixes (big problem with Toca), updates and free content.

"I love the game so much!! So much to do and so many episodes u could do, but there so problems that I have to deal with there's many bugs and it takes me put of the game for no reason avatar world please fix it. And one for thing we have to buy the nice stuff I know you guys need money to upgrade it but please make some of the pack free some players may agreed too but this is in my opinion please avatar world check this message out! But it's a really great game!! And I love it!","Review -> Bug Fixing, In-Game Purchases, Stability"
"I actually really love this game. No ads tons of free stuff with regular updates that include new options and sometimes gameplay. I genuinely get overwhelmed by just how much stuff I can play with. I bought a few dlcs but unlike other games I didn't feel that pressure to buy to enjoy the game. The free no ad version is amazing. I continue to be amazed by the stuff you can do, how you can dress up and decorate but also by the updates. ALL FOR FREE with NO ADS! I'd love to get another console game","Review -> Customization Options, Regular Updates, Ad-Free Experience, In-Game Purchases, Gameplay Variety, Free Content"
"I cannot withstand the magical simulation in this game. It really let's people show who they are. I've played Toca boca, but it isn't as kawaii as this one! This game is the one and only best avatar simulation game! I highly recommend playing this game. And another thing: you can change the style of the music and I LOVE the new city! If I could, I would rate this infinity â¾ï¸ stars! I love how there is even a cool movie ð¬ studio ð and a movie theater!

"It's really fun! I used to play toca but I had to pay for all the locations and I'm broke lol it's super detailed and I love the animations you added it so much easier to take off bags and coats now! I think it would so cool if you added more style clothing options like grunge, street wear and goth! It would help so many people make stories especially if they make videos but other then that it's super cool and fun to play.

"Everything said about this game is true, the amazing animation quality, cute style, versatile clothing up to date with today's fashion, cheaper price for asthetic bundles and much more but as all these pros together I have one thing to clear up. On certain events clothing around the map alters and in the stores you get to utilize the free clothing displayed on the mannequin this is awesome but a new event came and it stop stocking the previous clothing on the mannequin its gone forever","Review -> Event-Based Content, Customization Options, Limited-Time Availability of Items, In-Game Store, Mannequin Display Feature"
"Avatar world is a fun game to play to me because of how many new things there are. For instance, there is a new update every week or so making it very exciting. And so far, there are TWO new islands with cool new things. And they have new clothes every week! It changes all the time! And you can play with four friends online or offline. You can also get free things in the store. So I like this game because of how much it changes. It is amazing and I love it sooooo much! I hope you do to.

"The game is super fun and it dosent cost anything to buy the game but you can buy stuff in the game. I hope you can enjoy this game like I did when I got it. Basically it's like toca boca but way more realistic. Note to the game ð® you gotta have way more character slots, atleast 5 and here's my reason why: everybody has been asking for more slots so please ð fix this. But I would give this game a 5 star wonce you play it.

Note: Some features like Customization is mentioned in the product details and not in the review, however, the review mentions the game is similar to Toca Boca but more realistic, hence, it can be inferred that the reviewer likes the customization and realism of the game.

"This game is amazing! I love it so much! Thank you, Pazu for doing such a good job! I'm always excited for new updates, and I never disliked any of the updates. New places, new free stuff, new clothes, and so, so much more! They're always so cool and make me want to play more. The star dust city update might be my favorite! But, can you make more free stuff? I played it on the iPad in 2023, but my sister wanted it, so I tried to find it on my computer.

"This game is amazing, I love all the graphics, but recently, I've bought a couple of packs and within 2 months, the pack I bought is gone. And I'm spending good money,I don't have time or energy to waste money on packs now. My house is reseting, and my characters are missing. If these issues keep accuring, I may have to stop playing Avatar world altogether if these bugs keep on happening during my role play experience. Please fix this as soon as possible for my better game play.","Review -> Graphics, In-Game Purchases, Character Management, Home Customization, Bug Fixing"
"I am absolutely obsessed with Pazu Avatar World! This game is literally the coolest thing I've ever played, with stunning graphics, fun gameplay, and blissful features nd new updates. I mean, what's not to love? I can play it whenever I want, wherever I want, and it's just the best feeling. But, I've a few suggestions for a cruise, apartment building or complex nd a season option, changeable acc to our choice. Pazu team, you've got to do smth about this! Overall, I simply love this game! ðð¤","Review -> Graphics, Gameplay, Customization, Seasonal Options, Location Variety, Apartment Building/Complex, Cruise Option"
"Avatar World: Games for Kids is a fun, creative game for ages 5â12. Players design characters, explore colourful environments, and create stories. Itâs visually appealing and kid-friendly but needs more luxurious houses, apartments, furniture, and places like museums, hospitals, etc. Adding better clothes for boys and girls need more clothes for boys, fixing glitches, and making all features free would improve it. Great for casual play, but repetitive over time.

"It's is a good game! I play this game whenever I get bored. However, I really love that you guys will add another shop or something, more free items and also the character creator, I really wanted to make a family of four, but I only have 3 slots in my character creator. And also in the character creator,i also wanted more designs, hairs, eyes etc. The hairs for me is just a bit boring. Anywaysss, that's all! This game really cures my boredom and yes I rlly like it a lot, and once again, I'm out","Review -> Character Creator, In-Game Shop, Customization Options, Character Slots, Hair Designs, Eye Designs"
This game is awesome! I also really like the water park update. This game is soo good and I really like the avatars too. Just plz add more colour wheel things on more pieces of items. And thx Avatar World creators and I rate it 5 stars. Like best app ever! Just 1 problem. When I wanted to get out a characters 2 mens clothes changed and their mouths were just a black line and for the women her eyes was just a black block and it made my bum feel weird and I was shocked.,"Review -> Color Options, Avatar Customization, Graphics Quality, Stability/Performance"
"It's a great game!! I've been playing it for about a year now. But there's two things i don't like about it, #1: Everytime it needs an update, you have to delete half the apps I already have. #2: just a suggestion, but you should definitely add more toys to the baby shop! Things like mabye.. baby bouncers, toy blocks, you know! Things other than stuffed animals. Don't get me wrong, kids LOOOOVE stuffed animals, but not THAT much. Evertime a play, I have to steal toys from the daycare ð thanks!","Review -> Storage Management, Baby Shop Toys Variety"
"So I've been playing avatar world for over two years. I do content about it on YouTube, and I the game is really fun and easy to use. There are some bugs, but in every update they get fixed. There's an update almost every week.Overall I love this app the characters are great, but avatar world could add three more character slots so people don't have to buy the pack. If they could add some more free packs that would be very nice, because you have to buy packs.

It's a good game but it needs aittle adjustment and U can get everything for free without buying it and its very fun for me and I'm happy we can make multiplayer games with our friends and I like it how other ppl can design our house and move items .it's not a bad game for mostly.

"When I first downloaded Avatar world for my kid on a road trip I was a bit skeptical.. but then after a few weeks my kid has been sitting still and not being his usual hyperactive self!! This saved me big time since I was new to parenting and it was alot easier since well of Toca Boca, my kid used to like playing Toca Boca but since it had alot of things you had to buy I just stood to this one because 1. There's alot up updates, 2. Better avatar choices, and 3. Because it has alot of free items!","Review -> Updates, Avatar Choices, Free Items, Engagement and Calmness Inducing Capability"
The game is loads of fun u can do a lot but u can only play up to like 30 mins and then the game stops and a subscription add pops up and u cant play other than that its really fun and i think the creators did a great Job ( edit here) so basically it's one of the best games in the world I can't stop playing it Beautiful I love all the new updates and clothes I wish younguys would give us some more access too the packs tho they look amazing and not all of us can afford it but other than that â¤,"Review -> Game Duration, Subscription Model, Customization Options, Accessibility, Updates, In-Game Purchases, Affordability"

"So this is my first review! If I could give decimal numbers for ratings, I'd give it about a 4.5. It's a cute game with in app purchases that aren't major but would probably help increase your desire to play. Everything is swell but you can't move furniture upstairs, the free furniture is LACKING. And for some strange reason, you can only use like about 20 characters on all maps.

"I've been a big fan of this game since 2024, and I really appreciated that you didn't require players to pay for everything to get cute items or other fun stuff.

"I love this game, it's free and you don't need to pay to access other places. I'd rate it 5 stars but I have just one problem with it and it's the hosting a world feature where you and your friend can play together in one world, I love everything about it but I just hope that the progress we've made could save because my friend and I decided to play together in my world and she customized her house there.

This is just an idea because some people can't afford the packs they would like. I like how all locations are free.

"I love Avatar World and was excited about the new multiplayer update. However, I faced a big issue. When I hosted a multiplayer world with my sister, we decorated and built many things. But when I accidentally quit the game and re-hosted, the entire world reset, and all our progress was gone. Itâs very frustrating that multiplayer worlds donât seem to save when the host leaves. Please consider adding a save feature for multiplayer sessions so players donât lose their hard work. Overall it's win","Review -> Multiplayer World Persistence, Auto-Save Feature"
