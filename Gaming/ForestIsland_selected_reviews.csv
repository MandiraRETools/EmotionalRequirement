"I like what they're trying to do, but you have to watch lots of ads just to get anywhere. They are optional, but without them, you're left with nothing much to do. I'm especially annoyed with the events. The one we just had said it ended on 2/28/25, yet it is just past 8:00pm and the event has changed. I wish there had been a timer countdown instead so I knew when it would change over. I would have reached the end of the challenge had I known it wouldn't last until midnight. I'm so frustrated!",like theyre trying watch lot ad get anywhere optional without youre left nothing much im especially annoyed event one said ended 22825 yet past 800pm event changed wish timer countdown instead knew would change would reached end challenge known wouldnt last midnight im frustrated,1
"Great sfx, animations, and concept. Some camera angles aren't great, and no good way to move it. But I like the camera album reward system concept and the creature eggs. No forced ads which is nice. No way to buy the game though or subscribe. And when I tried to log in it glitched. Now it wont even load. I've tried all I can, but I have to uninstall and reinstall. If it continues to try and log me in to my ""saved yet corrupted"" progress, then I can't play.",great sfx animation concept camera angle arent great good way move like camera album reward system concept creature egg forced ad nice way buy game though subscribe tried log glitched wont even load ive tried uninstall reinstall continues try log saved yet corrupted progress cant play,1
"Very cute and while ads are NECESSARY to progress, none of them are forced on you. I love supporting a game like this, and that's where my problem came in. There's a way to remove ads... for $45. I would pay that price for a complete version of this game, but there's a couple dozen large micro transactions after getting rid of ads.

"Fun, but you quickly realize YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS without watching TONS of ads. 30-50 per day. sure they're ""voluntary""... but they're not voluntary if you want to progress. once you get the Rainforest, just uninstall, there's nothing more to obtain. took about a week. every single inch of this game is covered in opportunities for you to pay money. the animals are cute, but it's not a true idle game (doesn't progress while app is closed) and it really feels like a shameless cash grab.",fun quickly realize progress without watching ton ad 3050 per day sure theyre voluntary theyre voluntary want progress get rainforest uninstall there nothing obtain took week every single inch game covered opportunity pay money animal cute true idle game doesnt progress app closed really feel like shameless cash grab,1
"This game is wonderful! It is very soothing and is full of cute animals. However, I've recently came across a bug.

"The game itself is very calming and relaxing. The problem with it though, is that the photos only print, and end up in the photo album about half the time. The other half, you take a photo and wait 10 minutes, only to find out it didn't save, because the camera feature in this game is seriously bugged. Probably gonna end up deleting the game because that glitch is so frustrating to deal with.",game calming relaxing problem though photo print end photo album half time half take photo wait 10 minute find didnt save camera feature game seriously bugged probably gonna end deleting game glitch frustrating deal,1
"Wish I could recommend higher. Fun, cute game. Leveling up requires watching many ads, and half the time ads fail to load and you have to sit through 1-2 min of a black screen over and over and not get your ad reward. (But it's a real ad bc if you tap the screen it pulls up a Google Play page for a game.) I just tried to get my ""heart dolphin x3"" reward 4 times and - nothing.

"I love this game. Ive been playing a about 6 months now and it's just so cute. I'm giving 4 stars because the ads can be way too much. Sometimes they are a minute long, and sometimes you have to click out of them 3 times before they go away. I wish this could be fixed but im sure it's those stupid app developers that make the ads.

"Cute, but I wish there weren't so many things to purchase. Kind of ruins the experience whenever you get a pop up for an animal you have to pay for. Can't the different patterns on the animals just be rare or something? Or Can't they have babies without you having to pay if you have a male and female?

"Really neat game and quite beautiful, definitely a game to play while trying to fall asleep to. Although I personally had some issues, I hope others don't have this same issue; the game will just, not let me use the egg feature after, zooming in on nothing. I used it once, and whenever I click off this invisible egg it disables the bottom boxes from getting clicked. Seperate from this was also the inability to call albatross, dolphins, or claim free items, rendering me unable to continue.

"really beautiful game and I love the variety of animals and birds offered, but there are so many glitches! sometimes you watch ads for whole minutes and do not get the rewards (hearts/energy/foggy tokens) that were promised. also for the cherry blossom heart buff, I have never gotten the full ten minutes promised because it always glitches and takes a full minute or more off my allocated time (sometime in the last 5 minutes). ads are a lot, but glitches are worse!!",really beautiful game love variety animal bird offered many glitch sometimes watch ad whole minute get reward heartsenergyfoggy token promised also cherry blossom heart buff never gotten full ten minute promised always glitch take full minute allocated time sometime last 5 minute ad lot glitch worse,1

I don't care about the eggs if they're causing too many dev problems. But anytime the majority of us click on the egg icon (usually accidentally) it freezes the whole game.

"I love it so far. I caters to my grinding habits really well. And the concept and designs are really cute. My only nit pick is that it doesn't have a dark/night mode so it's really bright all the time. And the weather isn't manually set either so I can't have rain on 24/7.

"It's a nice little game and since I got it yesterday, it's been fun. Yet, within a day it's very easy to tell that without watching ads you will get fundamentally nowhere. In-app purchases aren't required but are nearly shoved down your throat with how many there are. Progress stagmates rather quickly after a single day even when watching ads constantly.

This game was an easy 5 star rating when I first started playing. Then it all came crashing down when the potentially game-breaking egg glitch happened to me. When tapping the egg I am unable to interact with the game until I hit the back button on the phone. Yet when I do this it pretty much breaks the game and I cannot tap anything. Even after an uninstall it is still unplayable. Tried to go to player support and it is all in Korean!

I downloaded this game last week and at first it seemed enjoyable. For the past 2 days each time I log in and try to watch an ad to move to the next step it plays the ad in full and then the app crashes and has to reload only to log back in and see that I didn't even get credit for watching the ad. I can no longer progress in the game and this is VERY frustrating because I believe the game is trying to FORCE me to buy the ad coupons. I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't spend $$,downloaded game last week first seemed enjoyable past 2 day time log try watch ad move next step play ad full app crash reload log back see didnt even get credit watching ad longer progress game frustrating believe game trying force buy ad coupon would recommend game anyone doesnt spend,1

"*PLEASE FIX EGGS* I really love this game but I'm betting driven mad by the glitch that is eggs currently. I hatched my first egg on the tutorial, went to hatch a second egg, rubbed it, and then it poofed. Completely disappeared.

I'm unable to use it while moving/rotating the screen or tapping on animals to pick-up coins, hearts, & diamonds, yet I can use it while tapping to upgrade: locations, animals, & purchases, &or take pictures; etc. I hope the next update will change that?

I opened one, but now even though it says there is an egg nothing shows up, I can't see it, and even worse if I accidentally click on that area once I zoom back out I can no longer collect items or do the photos, I have to quit and relaunch the game to have those things work again.

"I love the aesthetic of this game. My main problem with it, like every other mobile game, is the ads. They're too pervasive. What's more, instead of offering a one-time buy to stop ads like you get with most apps, you have to purchase ad tickets, which seem like they're only going to be good for one ad at a time. I refuse to skip ads like this. Another more minor problem, but major from a gameplay perspective, is that the egg has disappeared, and if I try to click where it's supposed to be, it just freezes my game. No matter how many times I close the app and come back, the egg is still not visible or interactable, and clicking its location or the icon for it in the lower left freezes my game again. Support for the game is not available in English, and I don't know... Korean, maybe? As I said from the start, I love the aesthetic of this game. If a low-priced one-and-done option to skip ads existed, I'd buy it. Hell, if it was a one-month ad-skip ticket, I'd probably buy it if it was inexpensive. But until these two issues are fixed, I can't recommend it to anyone who would have problems with broken content or an expensive ad-skip monetization system.",love aesthetic game main problem like every mobile game ad theyre pervasive whats instead offering onetime buy stop ad like get apps purchase ad ticket seem like theyre going good one ad time refuse skip ad like another minor problem major gameplay perspective egg disappeared try click supposed freeze game matter many time close app come back egg still visible interactable clicking location icon lower left freeze game support game available english dont know korean maybe said start love aesthetic game lowpriced oneanddone option skip ad existed id buy hell onemonth adskip ticket id probably buy inexpensive two issue fixed cant recommend anyone would problem broken content expensive adskip monetization system,1

"I cannot support any game that sells ""ad coupons."" To do anything productive you gotta watch 30 second ads every... 30 seconds. Instead of selling a ""remove ads"" package like other games, they sell ""ad coupons"" which basically let you skip one ad at the cost of (usually multiple) coupons.

"I've played regularly for 18 days now. Growth level 11. Writing this review because I've hit a pretty big downtime in gameplay. ---####--- In summary, the game is very cute, it's a well-balanced idler with two currencies that interact well with each other. There is interesting gameplay interaction between the growth, achievements, level-ups, and especially the quests. The ads are not exactly required early on, but much needed if you don't want to advance at a snail's pace. They become obligated once the quests require them. ---####--- Gameplay: Cozy, not stressful. The animals interact a bit with the environment, but not with you. Do your little things around the island for about 10 minutes here and there throughout the day. The quest is the most fun element, making you somewhat plan ahead. The points they give you allow some player agency in how to grow their talents. It's fun to optimize energy and heart gains and quests with gameplay elements like photo or blossoms. The egg ""lootbox"" requires some luck but it's not very punishing, although the +% production birds are the clear desired items. The quests are not based on luck at all, which assures a steady progression. I've watched a ton of ads through this game however, to be allowed to progress. ---####--- My current situation, and complaint, is how the heart generation curve did not keep up with the quests or energy generation, which makes it unbalanced. I'm 18 days in, got great bird luck at 35, growth level 11. I've been doing quests as fast as I could. I reached level 75 of the Cloud Hills through energy before even being able to buy a single Sheep for 10.00f heart, which is my current quest. I'm getting pitiful amounts of heart through all the possible sources: blossoms give 0.15f, dolphins give 0.04f, 1h tickets give 0.14f, 150min of otter give 0.45f at 3x. ---####--- This step will take me about 3-4 full days to complete, which is the longest I've been without completing any quest. The devs should be wary of such a stagnant part of gameplay, which has already been pretty much the same since the Deer Meadow, or since the egg and photo additions. ---####--- It's fun to do these tiny tasks, although it gets repetitive and the rewarding gameplay took a huge halt around hearts for the sheep. I got super lucky on birds and watched all the ads I could. I'm dreading the time it will take me to obtain all the hearts for the next animal. This huge gap in quest completion has sadly eroded my interest, what felt like a fun game might start feeling like a chore now.",ive played regularly 18 day growth level 11 writing review ive hit pretty big downtime gameplay summary game cute wellbalanced idler two currency interact well interesting gameplay interaction growth achievement levelups especially quest ad exactly required early much needed dont want advance snail pace become obligated quest require gameplay cozy stressful animal interact bit environment little thing around island 10 minute throughout day quest fun element making somewhat plan ahead point give allow player agency grow talent fun optimize energy heart gain quest gameplay element like photo blossom egg lootbox requires luck punishing although production bird clear desired item quest based luck assures steady progression ive watched ton ad game however allowed progress current situation complaint heart generation curve keep quest energy generation make unbalanced im 18 day got great bird luck 35 growth level 11 ive quest fast could reached level 75 cloud hill energy even able buy single sheep 1000f heart current quest im getting pitiful amount heart possible source blossom give 015f dolphin give 004f 1h ticket give 014f 150min otter give 045f 3x step take 34 full day complete longest ive without completing quest devs wary stagnant part gameplay already pretty much since deer meadow since egg photo addition fun tiny task although get repetitive rewarding gameplay took huge halt around heart sheep got super lucky bird watched ad could im dreading time take obtain heart next animal huge gap quest completion sadly eroded interest felt like fun game might start feeling like chore,0

"So I absolutely love this game and would give it 5 stars, if it was prior to the update. Since changing the clam in the water it has been a pain to try to advance. This made watching 6 videos at a time for 60 gems kind of worth doing so. There was no limit. Now you get 12 videos every 24 hours and you get maybe..... idk it makes it all feel impossible to advance.

"An uninspired idle game that looks and sounds excellent with a ""relaxation/zen"" nature aesthetic. Ironically the aesthetic is beat within an inch of it's life by an overwhelming glut of advertisements and attempts to sell you a product. The clash between the beautiful scenery and capitalist greed is humorous but ultimately frustrating and culminates in yet another pathetic cash grab. 2 stars because at least the artists did a good job.",uninspired idle game look sound excellent relaxationzen nature aesthetic ironically aesthetic beat within inch life overwhelming glut advertisement attempt sell product clash beautiful scenery capitalist greed humorous ultimately frustrating culminates yet another pathetic cash grab 2 star least artist good job,0
"Honestly, I had very low expectations, when I first saw this, I was thinking to myself: ""Oh its gonna be these games that took forever to finish"" The reason why I dowloaded it cuz to see the advertisment for it was actually good, and I got my answer if it was good or not, this game was actually very good and i loved it, please keep updating this game, but the grindy parts do get a bit annoying, but its easily made up for the looks and animals.

Extremely relaxing. The ads can be somewhat invasive.

"It's a good idea but the development seems to be scattershot. 1) It's hard to see what all is going on because I can't play the game in landscape mode. Which seems like a pretty stupid and obvious usability issue to me. 2) The game support interface hasn't been internationalized yet, which means a core piece of functionality doesn't work for anyone who can't read Korean.

"Downloaded, played up to seal's rest. Sadly, the game is rife with predatory microtransactions. Do not play if you're an impulse buyer.

That's when the game showed it true colors. Now, I just feel guilty having spent money at all.
