"Constant ADs: banner ads, before, and after a game as well as whether or not you want extra items. Game functionality is good but the number buttons on the bottom are a bit too small and close together leading to incorrect inputs sometimes especially if you have long nails and likely an issue for larger fingers too. Game on its own is 4.5 stars but ads every other minute (especially if you solve the easier puzzles fast) are WAY too many. They should implement a timer so you can't have too many.","Review -> Game functionality, Ads (banner ads, before, and after a game), Number buttons, Timer for ads, Extra items"
"Great app. Levels are challenging. Easy levels are great for introducing people to the game. I enjoy the really puzzles. Extra features and pencil feature are smooth and easy to use. I'm not big on the events but that's just me. The ads can be a little annoying due to being given an ad after every level completion, hint, pause, resume, etc. Thankfully they are 5 seconds two or three times. It would be better if you were spared the ads if you solve a without any mistakes.","Review -> Thousands of Free Puzzles, Note Mode, Helpful Boosters, Daily Challenges, Track Your Progress, Play Sudoku Offline or Online, Undo and Erase, Highlighting, Four Difficulty Levels, Secure Account, Ads"
I play this game every day and have done so for years but the latest update is horrendous. The font size has been increased so much the screen is now cluttered and too noisy even on the smallest setting. The overall grid seems to be smaller than before with lots of dead space and excessively large numbers at the bottom. It is impossible to concentrate or see clearly with this dreadful update. The help centre does not seem to allow freestyle feedback.

"Tried this out as my previous app seemed to have played with how easy the puzzles were across the board. Difficulties here are OK but I keep accidentally clicking the auto fill button when I mean to click candidates, as the buttons look very similar. This takes me to an unskippable ad on each puzzle.

This game had grown to 4+ starz and a personal favorite. Then the side game 'Aquarius' reduced 5his to 3â rating with the addition of ads with.extended times. They cannot be broken. Then there are continuous loops to app store for loading new games that you are not interested. Then in loop between app store and game. This looping can last 2-3minutes. It is no longer my favorite.

"The app interface is very good, but several times now, the app has given me an incorrect sudoku. To be a true sudoku, there can only be one solution, which is the premise for the ""unique rectangle"" solving technique. These incorrect puzzles end up with a rectangle of squares with exactly two candidates, the same candidates in each one. This is an impossible configuration for a puzzle with only one solution, and it forces you to guess which solution the developer intended.

"Get at your own risk! I uninstalled it and won't reinstall. At first, I loved it. I wasn't interested in sudoku before, but got hooked with this game. The reason for the bad review is because it randomly tried to give me a virus!

I, of course, immediately clicked OFF the website and promptly uninstalled. Shady AF!",Review -> None
"The ads are B.R.U.T.A.L. Everything else about the game is solid. But for every minute of play time, you will have about 2 minutes of ads. There are 2 ads between every round. I've never had such an ad intrusive game experience. And if you want to pay for ad free, it's $13/year. Not a one time fee. Per year. For Sudoku. If you can tolerate 2/3rds of your time being ads, go for it. Or if $13/year subscription sounds good, go for it. Otherwise, you might want to look at the alternatives.","Review -> None of the mentioned features, but it mentions ads and subscription which is not listed in the provided features."

Only complaint: levels are rather inconsistent. An ""extreme"" puzzle can range from very easy to extremely hard (only solvable by following an arbitrary decision chain, and in some cases even that doesn't work and you'd have to follow branching chains, which is extremely onerous and requires paper notes). Anyway, great app.","Review -> Thousands of Free Puzzles, Four Difficulty Levels, Note Mode"

Even though the value in that box is not violating the sudoku rules at that point of time, it is still showing it as a mistake.

"Too many ads. Forced to make you wait while ad runs it's course. However, to the guys at Oakever Games credit; I received a very quick response to My review . Let's hope everyone starts to limit the ads as they are becoming a nuisance in their current set up. We understand the ads pay revenue, however at what period do we say the ads are ruining the experience and using up time on the person's device while playing the game. Thank you for your quick response allowing me to edit my review.",Review -> None (Ads are not a listed feature)
"As others have stated, the amount of ads in this game are excessive & aggressive. Before a level starts, you have to watch an ad. After 5 minutes or less, you complete a game and are forced to watch another ad... and if you earn rewards or items, those require watching an ad to boost the items from a single to about 3 more. The game is clean and easy to do, and I love sudoku, but the ads really kill the experience. Edit: lately, the ad games have been installing when exiting the ads. Not cool.","Review -> Thousands of Free Puzzles, Helpful Boosters, Play Sudoku Offline or Online"
"I like the app and I like sudoku. The only problem I have is the amount of ads. Before starting a match you have an ad, after beating the match there's an ad, starting a new match from the score screen another ad. Unpausing, theres an ad, your screen turns off, you turn it on theres another ad. Like come on, I get people need money for their work, but there doesnt need to be an ad for EVERY thing you do. I cant have a break w/o a flood of ads. The app would get 5 stars if not for ads. Not paying","Review -> Ad Management/ Monetization Model

"Edit: As if weight loss ads aren't bad enough, I now have ads opening web pages in my browser without my clicking on links. ENOUGH!! Game is generally good. However, the number of ads is becoming ridiculous, particularly those for dangerous weight loss products (it is not safe or healthy to lose 45lbs in 15 days, as promoted by your ads!!!). I understand the need for ads, but not for dangerous products. I'm old enough to know they're not a good thing, not all of your game users will be.","Review -> Ad Management (not explicitly listed, but implied as a necessary feature)"
"I am addicted to this game but the ads are super annoying. I get it, the ads generate revenue but to be interrupted after you complete a game and before you want to play another game makes me not want to play. The ads will play after I resume a game I've paused for less than 5 minutes. After 3 missed guesses the ads will play for 30 seconds +. I do like that the game allows you to add hints to what the numbers may be. I would rate this game 3 and a half stars if I could.","Review -> Helpful Boosters, Play Sudoku Offline or Online"
"Very good until an update in July 2022. Now completion of daily challenge sends you into a loop of advertising from which there's no escape other than closing the app, therefore the completion doesn't get recorded. Also the second chance feature just dumps you back to the Home screen. I will delete if it doesn't improve pronto. Edit, no improvement so deleted the game on 28th July. Sad times as I'd played the daily challenge for about two years.","Review -> Daily Challenges, Track Your Progress"
"Ads aren't intrusive. Wish the 'share' feature once you got your results would share an a hyperlink image showing time taken and number of mistakes so my family can be reminded how inferior they are to me. Currently it just shows 'you beat x% of players'. Also, not sure if it's a glitch or if this is really the case, but both times I've done the daily challenge it says it took me bang on 5 mins?","Review -> Daily Challenges, Track Your Progress, Share Feature (not explicitly listed but implied as a desired feature)"
"Ad frequency has increased a lot, with forced audio that pauses music which is very annoying. The events are too time consuming and dont adapt to player skill level, it's not enjoyable grinding through mindlessly easy puzzles for a badge, so I the entire feature is pointless to me. The game itself is fun and well designed for the format, but recently the app will start a new Sudoku when reopened rather than continuing the one I was working on, which then overrides the continue option.","Review -> Ad frequency, Events, Puzzle saving/continuation, Difficulty Level Adaptation

"This is a great Sudoku game but the ads are long and extremely annoying, and far excessive. . I refuse to ever buy any of those apps because the ads are that bad. One of the ads shows people supposedly winning thousands of dollars playing a bingo game. It's a shame that a game that is about challenging our brainpower forces us to watch so many long, moronic ads. The Sudoku game is excellent, 5 stars I love it. But the overall experience is 1 star. Long, idiotic ads before and after each game","Review -> Thousands of Free Puzzles, Daily Challenges, Note Mode, Helpful Boosters, Track Your Progress, Play Sudoku Offline or Online, Customizable Profiles, Four Difficulty Levels, Undo and Erase, Highlighting, Secure Account, Advertisements"
"Free Adless experience Yes this game has a lot of ads which gets annoying, found a way where we can play the game without the ads popping up. Follow the steps 1. Go to settings-->Apps and find the sudoku app 2. Click on restrict data usage and uncheck all the options including WiFi and save it. You would now no longer see any Ads. An alternative would be to turn off your data and WiFi and continue playing the game.",Review -> Play Sudoku Offline or Online
"Awful, annoying ads. They make the ads as loud as possible and impossible to shut down quickly enough. If you are hoping to get in a quick game of sudoku between tasks at the office. AVOID THIS APP! You have to keep your phone on mute with this one. WARNING TO ADVERTISERS: I AM KEEPING A LIST AND WILL NEVER BUY YOUR PRODUCTS BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING OUT.OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE YOUR ADS AS ANNOYING AS POSSIBLE.

"A lot of ads to begin with, starting a game = 1 ad, finish a game = 1 ad, starting another one = 1 ad. For example i play on average 20 games per day, so there would be like 40 ads per day for me. Thats just stupid. If there is a paywall for removing only just the ad, that would be nice. I might change to another sudoku app/game which I can just pay a sum of money to remove ads, have unlimited hints, mistakes and other features. The amount of ads just cut my excitement of playing this game.","Review -> Ad Removal Feature, Unlimited Hints, Unlimited Mistakes"
"I might update this review later but YIKES. I installed the game & before I could even play ONE GAME, this app made me watch TWO ADS! I get that ads pay the bills but seriously? Before I can even play ONE game to know if I like it or not, I have to watch 2 back-to-back ads (forst one was a 30 second ad, second was a 15 second ad) and no way to click out of it once the second ad is finally done? Just YIKES. This does not bode well. ð¬",Review -> No Mapped Features
"Uninstalling because far too many times there seems to be no solution except using brute force. Yes, you can get a hint -- unlimited hints, it seems, if you are willing to watch unlimited ads! But the hints are just solves; they don't prompt you to make the necessary logical connections. The pencil tool is nice, but having to resort to brute force-- and, worst of all, having no faith that there IS a logical solution, no matter how much time you spend -- is not fun.","Review -> Helpful Boosters, Note Mode"
Unfortunately my 1 stars is for excessive amounts of notifications. I'm talking at least 50 to 80 a day. I've paid for a years subscription I'm seriously considering a charge back. I've turned off notification even in the system and this app turns itself back on within a matter of hours. Do NOT PLAY. This app is phishing and manipulating the phones regardless of what we choose.,"Review -> None of the mentioned features directly relate to the issue of excessive notifications, however, the feature that could be indirectly related is:

"I saw the earlier review about ad excesses, still installed as I'm a sudoku fan But really so many ads? Start game-ad End game-ad Earn reward-ad Complete level-ad Just to experiment, I played 1 game & exited: 4 ads Developer response for the earlier review was for an option about removing ads from the setting It's nothing but to go for the premium The free version won't let you play at all It will force you for 2 choices 1.

"Too many adds, don't install. I love playing sudoko, but I lost the intrest now. With this app :- You start the app there would be adds. You start a game(new or continue) there would be adds. You will the game there are adds. Not 1 minimum 2 Advertisement of 30sec. And you can't close/cancel it ""x "" brings you to play store. It's very irritating. There are much better app available in store. Don't waste your time in this one.","Review -> No Mapped Features (The review talks about advertisements, which is not a functional feature of the Sudoku game)"
"The game itself is fun and the different options keep you interested, HOWEVER, the constant ads are too much. There's an AD before and after every interaction. They say after 5 seconds you can X out of the Ads but that's not being honest (and also not accurate for every Ad). Most Ads after 5 seconds you can click an X however a new screen for the same AD shows up. Some, like candy crush, pinterest, or mistplay make you to click 3-5 Xs before closing completely and each X is a few seconds extra.","Review -> No Mapped Features (The review talks about ads, which is not a functional feature of the Sudoku game)"

"Sooo many ads!! I don't often wrote reviews for apps but I am writing to express my frustration this time as this app annoyed me so much! There are SO MANY ADS in this Sudoku app. Every time you open the app you have to watch an AD. Every time when you are ready to resume the game after being interrupted and paused the gamw, you have to watch an AD. Every time you are ready to play a new round, you have to watch am AD.
