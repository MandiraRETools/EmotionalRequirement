"I love this app and what they do. But boy do I not like the update. I have a lot of problems with it. It's laggy, it hangs, sometimes won't load at all, randomly signs me out. I don't find it helpful that the first page doesn't just load up to meditations, but loads up to the accreditation message and you can't get rid of it.I also don't think the purple everything, or the organization of meditations are as clear or easy on the eyes as the old app was. I find myself using other apps more now.","Review -> Mapped Features

"It was really nice, i used it for a week,and I really liked the organization of it all and it helped me with my adhd. Then,out of the blue it. Changed into some ""mental fitness"" thing. Nothing works i cant find any of the sections or sessions. The whole app changed. I am uninstalling. I wish they could release the old version just as a separate app. This new one is frustrating and is completely different. Please give an option to download the old app.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, MENTAL FITNESS, PERSONALISED CONTENT, TRACKING FEATURES (implied by ""organization of it all"", ""sections or sessions"")"
"I've been using this app for years and it's always been my favorite meditation app. I had done almost all of the meditations and saved many of them as my favorites. I think the new update looks really good, however my problem with it (other than having lost all of my favorite meditations â¹ï¸) is that when I do a meditation, it is not marked as 'done'. Also some of the background music tracks do not work. I hope these bugs get fixed and thank you for genuinely caring about our mental health â¤ï¸","Review -> Meditation & Mindfulness, Mental Fitness, Tracking progress (Mental fitness tracker), Favorite/save content feature, Background music tracks, Marking meditations as 'done' feature"
I just downloaded the new update and I cannot believe what has happened to the app. Smiling minds has basically saved my life and now it's a garish garbled mess of random unorganized meditations and awful color and font choices. I can't make heads and tails out of it. Plus months of progress and curating are gone! Frankly the new layout is such a mess that it caused me anxiety. I really don't understand what happened but if the app doesn't revert I am removing it from my phone.,"Review -> Mapped Features

"I like this app. I was excited about the new families sleep section. Whenever I click on an idea to hear, it loads the screen, as if to play, and when I clicked the play symbol nothing plays. In addition, it addition, it prevents other programs from playing and I have to force stop Smiling Minds from running in order to get anything to work. Please correct this problem.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES"
"I really like the meditations on this app, and the tracking and reminders help me stick to a daily practice, but some functions don't work properly. When I ""favorite"" a session, it doesn't save, and my favorites remain empty. And after initial setup when I added programs to ""my programs,"" I can't add any more--I started a progem that I didn't initially add, and it won't log that first session or add the program to my list.

"It has a major bug that stops it from working. Each exercise you complete has to be registered by the app as complete before you can do the next. Unfortunately the app generally doesn't recognize that you have completed the exercise, so you have to play it repeatedly (usually 3 times) before the app allows you to .I've to the next exercise. Today I played it 4 times and it never registered as done, so I finally gave up.","Review -> Mental Fitness, Meditation & Mindfulness, Tracking progress (mental fitness tracker)"
"I really like this app, it's simple, direct, and free, but I have to keep that last star. Unfortunately, whenever I try to play my next session in my beginner course, I'm sent to my lock screen.

"UPDATE: I still find the meditations stopping half way. I was trying the ""Breath and Body"" meditation of 10:19 duration and it stopped playing at 4:07. Previous Review: I like the content in the app but the app is buggy. My main problem is that the meditations stop last thank half way through. Even a 7 minute meditation stop around 3 mins! I would really appreciate it if this issue could be fixed soon.",Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS
"Been using this app for 2 years now. It was one of the apps that got me through stressful moments during my college life and I know it would help me now that I'm working. Unfortunately, I can't log in to the app anymore eversince the new update. I've already sent an email but there's no reply. I already tried to uninstall and install but nothing happened. Hopefully I could log in sooner so that I'll continue to have a ""smiling mind"".","Review -> Login/Authentication, Update/Installation"
"This app is so frustrating!!! It constantly glitches, won't load or stops half way through. My kids love it and we've used it every night for years. Incredibly frustrating when it suddenly wont work. When I provided feedback, all they could do was ask for a screen recording. How is that helpful or even possible when the app won't even open!!! It has been worse since the update. It's not good enough.

"Definitely a 5 star app for me but the past few days, I have been unable to access the app. It just keeps ""loading"" but nothing fully loads. Honestly the best app but this current issue I'm having is having a big impact unfortunately. Hopefully there's some sort of fix because accessing this app is important.","Review -> App Launch/Loading, Accessibility/Usability"
"The version before the recent update was fantastic. The content is great however, the newer version is unreliable for tracking, consistency, even usability. I often open the app and it simply refuses to load anything. The notifications do not work. Meditations will stop midway. The titles on everything has changed, and for new users, I believe if I hadn't been using this for years before the update, some content will be locked to you. The app is now similar to ""Calm"" in the least desirable ways.","Review -> Tracking, Consistency, Usability, Notifications, Meditation, Content Locking, Mental Fitness Model

"Great app was having problems with it crashing during audio playback but realised it was being caused by me locking my phone to reduce the brightness in an otherwise dark room. Would be good if the app had a night mode (might already have one but ai haven't noticed it) and loads more longer meditations (more 15min, 20min, 30min).","Review -> Night Mode, Longer Meditations (15min, 20min, 30min), Dark Mode"
I really loved the old version of the app. I don't think there was a need to change things so dramatically. When I went to log back in a couldn't find my favourites they had been wiped.

"Such a frustrating app since they changed to the new version.. it constantly won't load, even after restarting the app, clearing the cache etc. There are less choices of meditations than what they had too. ETA: in regards to the response, the app may have more meditations in general, but there are less to choose from for my daughter that helped her with calming and sleep. We went through the app before and after the change and many of the ones we used have been removed.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, Offline Content (implied by ""clearing the cache""), Personalised Content

"The new app is very frustrating. I just want to find meditation recordings and they're buried under menus for various ""courses"". Now I need to meditate and I have to spend 15 minutes trying to find a useful session. Also the download button doesn't seem to work, and you don't have the option to download sessions whilst you're browsing, which the previous app did.

"Generally great app overall. Only reason for not five stars is the latest update is glitchy. Favourites suddenly disappeared, along with the option to add to favourites. Then the app crashed altogether. On restart things appear to be working again, but let's see. Also would have preferred a warning of the update, rather than finding out just when I'm ready to wind down for sleep and then having to add more personal info and navigate differently through the app.","Review -> Favourites, Update mechanism, Crash handling, User data management, Navigation"
"Personally, I don't think audiences get as excited about rebrands or new looks to apps as the developers are but that might be just me.

"The mindfulness and meditation content is great. The app itself is unfortunately plagued by playback issues, which make it kind of unusable at the moment. Playback randomly stops, and when that happens, there is not even a way to resume it other than backing out of the meditation and restarting it from the beginning. Imagine you are in sleep meditation trying to drift away and then playback suddenly stops and you have to turn the phone back on to restart the meditation and then it happens again.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES (Download content to use offline, Dark mode to help you relax before sleep)"
"The guide voice is pleasant and not patronizing. I find that the practices have a good ratio of talking to silence, and the comments are helpful rather than distracting. I keep the music on to help me focus, but like that there is an option to turn it off for when I'm ready for silent practice. Update: The new interface is cluttered and has an overwhelming amount of text and menus to click through to find what you want. Miss the old look and focus on meditation vs wellness content.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES (Music option, Silent practice option), User Interface"
"Previous version was great, new update is difficult to find the meditations, the colours that are used make it difficult to differentiate between options easily (especially for my neurodivergent brain) everything is hidden away...

"The new update is bad, as someone who was using this app for a couple years within my anxiety episodes, the sudden change was confusing and upsetting. I don't understand why they got rid of the collections of episodes, those were so good!

"You've ruined the best mindfulness app. It was simple, easy to use, and above all the colours and the design made the user feel calm and at peace. Now everything is anxiety purple, and about 600 tabs and pictures and videos are all over the place that would overwhelm the already overwhelmed user. And you topped it all with a subscription. Fantastic job. You're not bigger than Skype. They made a stupid update that everyone hated, so they rolled it back.

"Recordings will randomly cut out and you need to exit out of the recording, go back into it, and navigate to the spot you were up to to resume.

"I have used many apps, and fundamentally, meditation itself was not invented by scientists but developed by monks. Hence, many of the trainers lack the science behind the training and mostly expect us to understand as we go along, and this is no expectation.

"It's a no-nonsense mindfulness app with a clean interface and lovely narrator; it's become one of my faves. I really appreciate that it's free and just does what it advertises.

New update is full of bugs. Please fix! Loved this app until the update. Now it randomly stops and I can't even finish a 2 min meditation.

Talks through the exercises very clearly, option to turn the background music off, which is great depending on my mood.

The app makes it easy to form a consistent practice.

"I gave three because it may work for others but definitely not for me. I tried the sample meditation and I said I was hyper alert and not content and it brought me to a meditation that made me hyper aware of everything, quoting exactly ""the sensation of clothing on"" ""itching against the skin"" I do not need to boost the alertness hell no. Music was nice though. Edit: doesn't matter what you click in sample just brings you to the same one.",Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS
"I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge","Review -> Mapped Features

"Thank you, Smiling Mind! I have used a couple of meditation apps in the past. This is the most complete and the one that makes me wanna meditate. I particularly like the ending in most of your meditation practices: ""when you are ready you can open your eyes with a smile on your mind"". What I would like you to add is a calendar showing our meditation for the past months etc UPD Some changes lately have made the app unstable (constantly asking me to log in) and downloaded sessions don't play. 4*","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES (Download content to use offline, Track your mood with wellbeing check-ins), Calendar feature (not explicitly mentioned but implied as a desired feature)"

"I've been using Smiling Mind for a long time. I enjoyed it very much. It was the recent update on Androids system that upset me - For a few days now, the app quit during a process of an extended meditation, some time after my phone became inactive. It's unpleasant that I paused during meditations and found the app crashed and quit. I uninstalled and reinstalled just now. Hopefully this will change things for the better. Otherwise my experience with the app has been quite positive.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES (specifically, the ability to run the app in the background while the phone is inactive)"
"This app is everything I needed for combating anxiety, easing tension, and sleeping better at night. It's soothing, it's free, unlike other meditation apps that will try to charge you for your own mental wellbeing, and the sleep meditations? I don't use this app as often as I should, but whenever I do use it I am very grateful to its creators for making this available. EDIT: the app is pretty buggy on Android.

"A near perfect app which is completely free and rich of content. Thank you to the Smiling Mind team for bringing this application to the world. Two small suggestions. Would be great to add a seek button to move track forward or backwards if needed. Secondly, the audio theme in the background is great but it would be good to have a seemless loop instead of it ending and playing again. It looks like it stopped and can be distracting.","Review -> Seek button, Seamless audio loop"
"Really superb app. I was quite shocked at how effective the exercises were at dealing with some acute symptoms of anxiety and stress. Having a calming voice guide you through the exercises is really helpful, along with the gentle reminders that it's okay for your mind to wonder. For those who are annoyed with the music that plays in the background, you can turn it off by pressing the music note icon beneath the play button for the exercises. Personally I find it quite calming, but to each their own.

The only thing I'd change is the background music during the meditations - I find it very loud and synthetic. Soft nature sounds or nothing at all would have been preferable. Other than that, very happy so far. Edit: After finding that the background music can be turned off, I'm very happy.

People seem to forget that almost all of this app is provided FREE (only the Work category isn't) by a charitable organisation It comes with scores of well voiced, excellent meditations teaching children & adults how & importantly why to meditate.","Review -> Meditation & Mindfulness, Mental Fitness, Tracking progress (days since last used a meditation)"
"Great app, important to show how crucial our mental health truely is. Give 5 stars with a bit of a navigation update to the app (a bit readout to find out continue a trend based on what you are listening to, or tailor the recommendations based on time of day) and smarter health surveys (if I'm doing 3 sessions back to back, being asked how I'm feeling before each one is a bit tedious)","Review -> Personalised Content, Meditation & Mindfulness, Mental Fitness, Wellbeing Check-ins, Mental Fitness Tracker, Offline Content, Personalised Routines"
"We love it - The only advert I see is their own one, asking to donate. This is a free mindfulness and meditation app which is beyond fantastic, so sure enough they are entitled to ask for donations. Such a kind act to provide mind exercise for everyone, for free. Beautiful meditations, voices and background music. You can select if male/female voice, if music or not, to play after the meditation is finished.

I adore this app. I have been using balance and wanted some new inspiration. I love the tone of the voices as they are natural and not corny. Also the content is creative and welcoming and really allows you to develop your practice without judgement and is great to remind you that the mind thinks....and that's okay. My favourite part tho are the moments where it sparks curiousity into the meditation and your daily life. Well done!,"Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, MENTAL FITNESS"
"Smiling Mind offers a great collection of guided meditations, and to my surprise the best value for me has come from following the programs and especially the parts of the programs I wouldn't normally be drawn to (the parts I find the hardest) like really paying attention while eating or stretching! Over the past months Smiling Mind has helped me build from meditating infrequently to meditating almost every day. I've found myself being reminded more and more frequently to be present in the moment and find it surprisingly valuable! Thank you Smiling Mind Team!","Review -> Guided Meditations, Programs, Mindfulness (specifically mindful eating and stretching)"
"This is a great app with fabulous intentions, but oh my gosh that background music is grating. The guys voice would be fab against rain, storms, forest or waterfall sounds. That vibrating metal sound just prevents me from chilling out. Top effort, but to really feel the vibe, that background sound has got to go.","Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS, OTHER FEATURES (specifically Dark mode)"
"Decent app, but I couldn't get into it because of the choice of voice actor. I'm a young Australian male, and the least relaxing and wise voice I can imagine is the voice actor they have sadly chosen... A young Australian male. Please, for the next version, pick someone older, maybe female, maybe not Australian. Maybe a real meditation teacher like Jack Kornfield. For these guided meditations, at least for me, it's really all all in the voice, tone, emotional timbre etc. Thanks anyway :)",Review -> MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS
"Googled best mindfulness apps. This was listed. I want a simple app that will help me start a mindfulness habit. Simple Mind ain't that. I was able to download another app, set it up and complete my first session and clearly see what the next step is in less time than I spent answering smiley face questions.

I absolutely love this app. Seriously it is awesome to find an app that gives me what I truly need and doesn't charge, however I am definitely going to be giving a donation as I feel the app is very much worth it!

"This app is very helpful for me as I suffer from GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder). It only requires a few, eg 5-10 minutes to take some time out and look inward at how I'm managing my thoughts, emotions, mood, and helping me deal with possible causes, internally and externally, eg, places, environments, people that may create stress for me. It shows simple methods for helping restore calmness and understanding my feelings. This was recommended by my O.T.

Not a fan of the inclusion of Facebook Analytics in a mental health app and thus contributing to Facebook's poor behaviour towards their users' mental health though.

"I completed the 1 minute mindfulness after the ""Intro to mindfulness"" segment. I love how the intro explained mindfulness is Not mindlessness! This 1 minute meditation segment is a bit over 3 mins. due to explaining prior meditating.

"I totally disagree with the meditation track saying ""no pets in the bedroom"" as they disrupt sleep. SOMETIMES this is true, but having my cat on my pillow was the only thing that helped me sleep soundly when I was severely depressed. Middle aged/senior cats are usually, in my experience, quiet and sleepy through the night (especially if they have snacks out). Young pets may be quite different!!
