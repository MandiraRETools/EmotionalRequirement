"day two and I'm already feeling the change in my stress level. free trial gave me access to everything so I haven't looked around and seen all that available, but so far, I'm VERY impressed by this app!! I'm already feeling less anxious and if I ever hit a panic attack, they have an SOS meditation guide for on the spot needs. I love this one so much, can't wait to see what all I can get accomplished as I strive towards a more stress free life! thank you devs so much for opening up the trial!!â¤ï¸â¤","Review -> SOS meditation guide, Free trial, Personalized guided meditations, Animated breathing exercises"
"I did the Balance one year free trial a few years ago but didn't manage to build a consistent habit and ended up trying a few apps that were either totally free or had a good number of free meditations. I ended up coming back to Balance and buying a lifetime membership and am meditating daily now. I like that each meditation adapts and that some gives options (like the Pomodoro session). I also like that everything is rooted in science and explanations are given, no esoterism to be found.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Adaptive meditations, Pomodoro session, Science-backed explanations, Lifetime membership"
"Really great app. Love all the quiet options to relax for bed or have soothing white noise type things playing. Would be 5 stars if there were cast support. My kids love the sleep meditations, and I can use the media output settings built into my phone to play things on the Google speakers in their rooms, but it's clunky and disconnects all the time. Cast support would be great to set it and forget it so it's playing on its own and not relying on my phone. Other than that, I love it!","Review -> Sleep Meditations, Media Output Settings, Cast Support"
"It would be good, if there was an option, to restart the meditation plans at any points, if I feel got lost with them, or repeat anytime in a later point in the future. Also there is a bug, if a fullscreen notification comes up, like a calendar reminder, will makes the meditation stop, and when recognising that it was stopped, and get the notification out of the way, the meditation would just start from the beginning, instead continue from the point it was disrupted.. Please resolve these.","Review -> 10-day Plans, Guided Meditations, Meditation Sessions, Breathing Exercises, Singles

"I was diagnosed with dysautonomia (from covid) and have troubles with anxiety, tachycardia, blood pressure spikes, pvcs, fatigue, seeing/feeling/hearing my pulse, chest pain, pressure in chest, vertigo, vision blacking out, etc. I stumbled upon this app, and it has really helped me to reduce stress levels, raise my HRV, get a better night's sleep, gain more energy, and am able to switch back into parasympathetic much faster now. If you struggle with stress or sleep, I HIGHLY recommend Balance!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Sleep meditations, Breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, Relax, Energize, and Concentrate daily guided meditations, Foundations Plan, Advanced Plan, Guided breathing exercises"
I'm on Day 2 of the free 1-year trial. I love the guided meditation practices and the numerous categories that you can choose from. There's also an unguided option in case you don't or can't follow along with a guided session. It can be distracting for some people to hear someone throughout a 5- or 10-minute session. I've been going through a severe depressive episode and bouts of general anxiety. These last two sessions helped me to focus and mentally regroup. I can't wait to practice more.,"Review -> Guided Meditation Practices, Unguided Option, Categories for Meditation Sessions"
"I have been looking for a good, efficient mental & emotional health company & app where I can truly feel the results and I don't have to stop & be limited because of subscription costs. although I agree with subscription costs in order ro run the company, staff & all things related to the app, it made it difficult for me to get healthy. but when I tried this company & their app, their kind yr long free subscription has truly helped & I just started last night. I am forever greatful. I recommend!","Review -> Free Subscription, Personalized Program"
"I saw this was offered at a full year for free & I was immediately interested. Most apps give you, at most, 2 weeks free. I felt they must have faith in their product to offer that kind of promo. I've used it daily, 1-3 times per day, for 3 weeks. It is hands down the best meditation app I've ever used. I look forward to meditating instead of feeling like it's a chore or task to complete. I've gotten a few friends using it also. I'm hoping I'll be able to afford the lifetime discount plan. ð¤","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Research-backed activities, Calming sounds, Sleep meditations, Lifetime discount plan, Free trial period"
"This is by far the BEST meditation app out there. I love all the singles, I love that in the ""breaking habits"" one if you select smoking they don't specifically say cigarettes in the meditation (I'm trying to quit weed). Ofosu has a very soothing voice and I love all the educational aspects. I got a whole year free trial and I try to use it every day. This is the only app that's actually helped me sustain a meditation habit, and I've tried a LOT of them. And there are NO ADS in the free version!","Review -> Singles, Breaking Habits meditation, Educational aspects, No Ads in free version, Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises"
"I love this app!!! Due to undiagnosed ADHD, I stopped meditating due to my increasing inability to sit, focus, and enjoy the moment. I typically never gravitated towards guided meditation because the repetition was even worse. Balance has restored my meditation routine bc the meditation can be as little as 5 minutes, and you never get the same guided meditation twice!!!! That keeps me engaged and looking forward to the next one. I've gifted one year to so many ppl. You'll love it!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Bite-sized Singles, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises, Variety of guided meditation sessions"
"I came into this with an open mind. No set expectations , just a curiosity and a willingness to try and to give it my all, no halfway effort. This has really made a complete positive change to my overall feeling mentally, physically and emotionally I feel better... I had played the exercises aloud and my friend wants to do this as well. The guide is amazing, his voice.is everything, his manner is positive and warm. How he connects and comes across reached me","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, 10-day Plans, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations), Sleep meditations"
The nightly meditations and the daily skills I'm learning to meditate even better. I feel more relaxed when ever I finish one. At night it never fails to put me to sleep. I like that the lessons are short because I don't always have a lot of time on my hands. The fact that I get to try it free for a year too is great. It gives me a chance to really decide whether it's something that will work to help lower my stress and help me to gain better focus throughout the day. Thank you Balance!!!,"Review -> Nightly meditations, Daily skills, Short lessons, Free trial, Sleep feature, Stress reduction, Focus improvement"
"Lovely, generous. Adaptive to whatever your needs are. Personalized to each individual and their skill level. The best part for me is the speakers voices are fantastic. I tend to fixate on anything weird about a voice, like ticks, odd pauses, or gravelly/ nasal tone. But their voices are smooth, perfect, relaxing. This app has really helped me build a meditation practice daily and sleep at night. This is the first meditation app that also was able to teach me to breath correctly. Thank you!!!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, Sleep meditations, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)"
"I've been using this for a couple months on my phone and really liked it, of all the meditation apps I've tried it's the only one I found with sleep meditations long enough to actually help me sleep. Unfortunately, I just bought a new tablet and it doesn't work on it, it crashes immediately after the initial 'B' screen. Tried restarting the tablet, force quitting the app, uninstall and reinstall, but nothing has helped, so as it is the app is unusable on my device (still works fine on my phone).","Review -> Sleep Meditations, Cross-Device Compatibility"
"As of now, more limited meditation options compared to Headspace and the like. Still, the way the teachers emphasize certain physical skills to help, like focusing on a breath count or sensations at your pace, is amazing. Other programs I've tried so far focus on what the instructor's rate of breathing is, or vague descriptions of refocusing. The different methods taught in this app has helped me stay focused during the meditation (I have adhd, so that's a big thing for me). So far, so good.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises, Breath Focus meditation technique"
"I'm only on day 4, so I'm relatively new, but don't take this lightly...this is life changing. I suffer from chronic pain from Fibro, migraines, degenerative disk disease, etc. Things get better and worse, but research is showing Meditation is one of the best ways to treat chronic pain. I've never been able because it's always been ""visualize clouds"", etc. None of that here so far. Straight forward, understandable, and truly helpful. I'm doing several programs and singles easily. Thank you!!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, guided breathing exercises, animated breathing exercises"
"Downloaded a few months ago and am hooked! I use it every night to sleep. Love the simple app design that's easy to use doesn't overload with info, but allows you to click for deeper reading. I've listened to many meditation podcasts and calm type apps and this speaker's voice and energy is one of the most calming I've heard. I also love that the app will play simultaneously with Spotify, so I can play waterfall sounds or light music behind it if I choose. Seriously give it a try!","Review -> Simple app design, Guided meditations, Simultaneous playback with other apps (e.g. Spotify), Sleep stories/sounds"
I really like the daily program â¤ï¸ It's increasing my confidence in my own ability to meditate consistently. The narrator's is great âºï¸ I feel like all the sessions are personal and feel live. He doesn't instruct in a pre-recorded manner so that it feels like you are being left behind. He speaks like he has all day. I've never had an instructor have such realistic pace before. I also like that there's no background ambient music to start. I think it helps me take the sessions more seriously.,"Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Guided sessions without background ambient music, Narrator's pace and tone"
"I'm about a week in and this is very well done. I'm still on the free trial (which is a year, I love it. I wish more apps did something similar.) but I'm leaning towards a lifetime license closer to my trial ending. The personalization is great, the male voice is amazing, so relaxing and wonderful. I've tried meditation before but this app allows even a short 3 minute meditation to feel powerful, meaningful, and relaxing. Even with a toddler and a full time job, I know I can find that time.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Bite-sized Singles, Animated breathing exercises, 10-day Plans, Male voice audio library, Free trial/Lifetime license"
"Too repetitive... I just got started, wanted to use this app for my mood mostly but also tried procrastination. Felt like I did the same course 2 times. You want better mood? Take a deep breath... and out... you want to stop procrastination? Dake a deep breath... and out... There is nothing much to it, I chose 5 minutes per meditation and half of it is pure silence, other half is extremely repetitive. Hope it changes anytime soon, otherwise I feel like I already knew all this without this app.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Guided breathing exercises"
"Was ridiculous as a free app and was far far more than worth it when I paid for a lifetime membership. Had a headache last night that would not go away. Did the pain meditation... Gone. Couldn't get to sleep the other night. Did the sleep meditation? ð´ If something stresses me out the first thing I think is 'Gonna have to do balance tonight'. When I go to therapy and we get into some really heavy stuff, I use balance in the lyft on the way home and by the time I'm home I'm clear! It's awesome!","Review -> Pain meditation, Sleep meditation, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)"
"I'll be coming back to update this review actively. I started using Balance as of 06.01.22. I work at a fast pace environment so stress is always built up and I've had nowhere really to exhaust that pent up stress. Since I've started, after each session, I feel more relaxed and I get this interesting sensation after opening my eyes, like I'm at peace. I really like using this app any moment I can and I'm planning on keeping it.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations), 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises"
"Decent but restricting. I'd like to journal my emotions and mental well-being but the app is very limiting. Currently I'm feeling distressed and a little overwhelmed by life's choices. The options to journal my emotions are good, average, and not great. When I hit average I get tense, disconnected, neutral, tired, and unfocused. I understand development is trying to be inclusive, but maybe hire developers that have lived a day amongst other humans? I have emotions, try and make room for them.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Research-backed activities

"Was lucky to participate in a very long trial when the app first came out, used it to end and start my day. Also useful as a resource to study or do office work. Recently I found myself overwhelmed and came back to the app, bought the lifetime membership and haven't regretted it one bit! it's also fun to do the ""together"" singles like the couples ones. Honestly, I can't recommend it enough.

"I can't say enough good things about this app and how life-changing it is. At first, I thought meditation was hokey and that it wouldn't really work to help me better my life, but, boy, was I wrong. This app has helped me maintain and protect my peace, keeps me centered and grounded, and my life has such a sense of peace and wellness. It has also helped me sleep better.

"I stumbled upon the Balance app while searching for a meditation app for myself and my clients. What truly caught my attentionâand ultimately my heartâwas the presence of meditations led by a Black man. Representation matters, and hearing his soothing, calming voice moved me to tears during my first session. Itâs a rare and deeply needed touch in a wellness space that often overlooks diversity.

Very very helpful. One thing I'd absolutely love is some sort of queuing option, like in ""up at night"" there's meditation that slowly transitions into ""sunset melody"" loop track and can be set for 8-10 hours.

Pretty good app app far but I wish you could change your daily streak reset time. I like to meditate before bed but sometimes that's before midnight and sometimes it's after. Having to work about midnight to manage my streak gets annoying. It would be nice to be able to set the rest time to 3am (for example) so I don't have to worry about my streak being lost just because I meditate at 12.30am one night. I also would like to be able to edit past meditations especially where I made a mistake,"Review -> Daily Streak, Meditation Scheduling, Edit Past Meditations"

I always poo pood meditation because I had never found a good app. This app has changed my perspective on everything about meditation. His voice is so calming and reassuring I love it.

My brain kind of reset and it took almost three months to get back to some kind of normal for me.

"Love this app. Feedback: -the badge achievements are way too far reaching. It very quickly goes from achievable to wildly unrealistic which loses all interest in winning them. 1 month streak jumps to 1 year streak, thats physically impossible.

"I'm still not convinced, as a more experienced meditator, most of the skills they present are know to me, and revisiting them feels tedious and a chore. Furthermore, ""downloading"" a new session or narrator takes for ever, most times just freezes unable to chance the male or female voice, and gets stuck at ""downloading 0%"". Those are my main issues atm. I like how it takes in consideration what ever you input on creating the session. I have more positive things, but running out of characters.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Downloading sessions/narrators feature"

Despite already buying a year's worth of use from a competitor's app, I use Balance instead. I'm up to day five of Foundations V and I can feel the improvement in my mood and concentration.

Same with sleep audios, there's not a lot to choose from, and personally I didn't find ones that were for me. Also not being able to combine a sleep sound (like rain or quiet music) to meditation? For a free app, sure, it's ok, but I would never pay the full price for the app as it is currently.","Review -> Plans, Sleep Audios, Combination of Sleep Sounds and Meditation"

"It's good and I have found it useful. I completed the foundations 1 course, but foundations 2 seems to be the same.

Yes, I'm using my labels, I've settled into my posture, I can feel the support. But every meditation tells me to do it, even though I am already.

"I don't normally review apps but I feel compelled to review Balance. I have used it each day for the past 44 days. Why I love this app is due to its personalised approach, which I feel apps like headspace do not provide and end up feeling quite repetitive and generic.

"This app is now making me angry. I've done 50 days and just getting a basic meditation done is harder and harder. Look up how much people dislike the Body Scan. I was relieved when the app finally asked how much I enjoy Body Scan (Not at all). Its response ""Shame you don't like it, let's try more of it."" I'm now on sessions where I need to think about friends and things we've done in the past. This is not meditation!

Don't know if it was the soothing voice or the simple breathing practices or something, but it just made it easy for me to let it out. Never thought something this cliche would happen to me. Having a voice guiding me while meditating really helped me to stay in the zone, I think.","Review -> Guided meditations, Soothing voice, Breathing practices, Personalized program"

I did the current days and once I finished it it then showed I finished today's and removed yesterday's meditation streak record and put me back at one day.

"This is ok for beginners. I prefer the unguided. What's preventing me from taking advantage of their sale is the lack of binaural beats to select individually, along with different sounds like crickets, water, waterfalls, birds, brown, pink, white color, etc. Sound baths would also need to be added to justify their full retail price.

There's no option to cast to my Google Home devices â¹ï¸ Yes I could do Bluetooth but that would require me to use my earbuds and my main goal was to improve my sleep.

still unsure about it but I do like it more then other meditation apps and like that you get a too use this one free for a year if unable to pay because they don't believe that financial issues should stop someone from getting the help they need. that's one thing I will say that peeked my interest because with other apps you have to pay so much money for services or to unlock single sessions or even just for basic things but this one gives you a choice for your first year which I found amazing!,"Review -> Free Trial for a Year, Personalized Program, Affordable Pricing"

"I've unfortunately finished the free year and I have to say that while I enjoyed the experience, the personalisation feature is very underwhelming. Additionally the various meditations don't feel very different from one another. I've recently tried to download it again due to the fact it seemed they were offering another free year but despite being advertised so the free trial doesn't work.","Review -> Personalisation feature, Various meditations, Free trial"
"BEWARE: Useless, pointless app. Doesn't offer anything helpful. Signed up for the free trial and then deleted it after a week of use. Got my credit card statement today (51 weeks later) to say I've been charged the annual subscription fee of Â£61.99 for the next year. Going to request a refund as I haven't used the app in nearly a year and don't want it, but doubt I'll get anything back. Very sneaky and underhanded","Review -> Free Trial, Annual Subscription Fee, Refund Policy"
"Nice app. I purchased a lifetime subscription over a year ago because I was happy with the product. However, lately I've been trying to use my phone less to avoid distractions. I would have liked it if, while working on my laptop, I could just open a new tab, meditate, and go back to work. But it has been a year since I bought my subscription, and there's still no desktop app, or even a desktop website. Have switched to Calm for now. Hoping that this feedback is taken into consideration.","Review -> Desktop App, Desktop Website"
"Got to trial free for a year, didn't like it, so deleted the app after a month within the free trial without using it. Unfortunately, I didn't realise the payment ($110 each year after the first year) wouldnt be cancelled. I don't have that money to pay for something I did not find useful. Bit cheeky to not let people know you're about to charge them when they signed up a year ago. Please refund my money. I honestly have not used your app in months - just downloaded it today.

"Trying to work out if this is a scam or not. There seems to be a lot of positive reviews and the limited time I have spent with the app it does seem nice. However, trying to get access to the ""free year"" and it seems to say I'm not eligible for a free year. This only comes up if during the setup process I select a value of 0 to contribute towards the free year. If I select any other amount to contribute then I'm eligible. Unless I'm doing something wrong or it's a bug, it's not ""free"" for year","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Free trial/subscription model"
"Meh. Mainly because of the fact that you need to provide your credit card info to get a year trial. I understand why so many companies do this, but I believe it is not a good practice to shift the responsibility to the user to cancel the subscription after a year instead simply of blocking my access to the app. I would rather get a free access for a few days, but without providing my credit card. I also didn't like guiding voices, but this is just personal preferences","Review -> Free Trial, Subscription Model, Guided Voices"
"I can't emphasize enough how much i love this app! I really feel understood and as if every session is especially crafted just for me, adjusted to my progress, my needs, and my goals. Ever since I used this app, I notice a lot of improvement in the way my mind works. Also, the app interface is simply beautiful and somehow calming. Whoever made and runs this app, you guys are brilliant and I really appreciate what you do!

"Signed up for the free trial, pretty sure I cancelled this at the time as it is not in my Google Play subscriptions. No warning email, just a sudden charge of Â£62. Reinstalled the app and went to cancel the sub which was still showing active, it directed to the subs in GP. Which was still empty. Had to raise a ticket with Google to remove the subscription and am in the process of requesting a refund. Dirty, underhanded tactics to try and graft a few Â£ from people. Instant 1 star.","Review -> Subscription management, In-app purchase, Free trial, Auto-renewal"
Had been using a rival app until this came along. Was given a free years subscription to Balance so I thought I'd give it a go and see how it compared. I went in with no expectations and can honestly say I enjoy it more than their popular rival. The app is intuitive and uniquely tailored to each user which it's competitors cannot yet boast. I definitely recommend their other app 'Elevate' too. The fact that they gave me a free subscription to Balance encouraged me to subscribe to Elevate again.,"Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Intuitive interface, Daily questions about meditation experience and goals, Guided sessions assembled using a vast audio library

"Excellent app, beautifully designed and well thought out. I'm really liking it so far. I have just one small improvement suggestion: f.ex. when on Foundations screen and choosing one of the 10 days, the exercise and skills for that day will be presented. Clicking on a skill will open the Skill detail screen. Navigating back to the Foundations screen should present us the last day chosen. Instead, it gets reset to Day 1.","Review -> Foundations screen, 10-day Plans, Skill detail screen"
"Edit: it's fixed so 5 stars for now. +Rep for their super helping & quick customer support. App Has Some Annoying Glitches! This seems like a pretty good app but my own personal experience isn't turning out to be that good (or even good for that matter). There seems to be a glitch that keeps coming up wheneverI try to upgrade or try to access to the free one year option. The error comes up with the following message: ""Something went wrong. Please try again. Or contact support @ email address"".","Review -> Upgrade/Purchase Option, Customer Support, Free Trial/Subscription Option"
"Excellent app, I mean what an incredible way to help yourself with such a great mentor like this app. I am totally in love with ""Morning Brew"" The foundation classes streak.

"I found a charge of Â£ 61.99 on my credit card statement from Google playstore. I was surprised to find out that the free trial ended on April 24th, and the subscription was renewed without any email update. I didn't use the app except for the first few days of installing the app as my phone crashed, and I totally forgot the app. I strongly feel the autorenewal without email warning is a sort of customer exploitation.

Forces you to answer questions like age.no option around things. offers a free 1 yr but you can't exit out of that page either! You literally can't even see what they offer!!

You won't even see what the interface is like.,"Review -> Free Trial, Payment Method, Interface, Subscription Model"
"The more I've used the app, the more I've enjoyed it. Thank you to the developers! Please keep the one year free trial concept. Also, please keep the format/style of the app the same! Please don't integrate advertisements into it like other apps do. I want to feel relaxed while using it, and the simple interface helps. I'm pleased that you pay a one time fee to unlock the entire app. Balance means so much to me. I battle daily with my well being and it really helps. Thank you endlessly.","Review -> One year free trial, Simple interface, One-time fee, Personalized program, Ad-free experience"
"Crashes on Android 12 every time I try to start using. Fixed why this is - You need to ""log in to your account"" before you can start the years free trial, even if you have no account. This isn't at all clear on the opening page of the app which gives you the choice of starting your free year or logging in. This needs looking at by the developers. Haven't looked at app too much yet but once I got past the initial issue above, the app seems to be promising. Worth trying the free trial anyway.","Review -> Login/Account Creation, Free Trial"
"the free year is unlocked once you put your card details. why would you need it if it's free? out of jokes, many apps really do have a free period and then ask for payment details. those app don't feel like the creators only want more money. those app are good, and I usually stick with them and end up paying money for a membership. you should take those app as an example.",Review -> Free Trial or Subscription Model
"Be careful when choosing the free trial, once it ends it automatically enrolls you into its $100/year subscription whether you use the app or not. Card got billed even when the app has been long gone from my devices. Only realized that my money has been stolen after noticing a suspicious charge on my credit card statement. A sly but patient trick that most people will fall for once they are done with the app, forgetting about the subscription and being charged unknowingly despite not using it.","Review -> Free Trial, Subscription Model"
"absolutely fabulous. such varied things for support. love the sleep stories, work every time and sleep so well. tried the daily one based on mood today and brilliant. it's the best investment I've made ever and is supporting me fabulously.

I only had the free trial for a year for a few weeks and then signed up to the lifetime.","Review -> Sleep stories, Daily meditation based on mood, Personalized guided meditations, Sleep meditations"
This is a scam. Says cancel before this specific date. So I did and they still charged me. I can't get it refunded because google says it wasn't a fraudulent transaction. But I cancelled so why am I getting charged 2 months later? It's been weeks and no one has resolved my issue. I got blow off emails in response to all my requests. This is really horribe customer service.,"Review -> Subscription Management, Refund Policy, Customer Support"
"My 10yo son inadvertently signed up for the trial and it took me weeks to figure out where the $100+ charge on my credit card came from. I got sent around in circles between PayPal, Google, and Elevate. Google didn't even bother to respond and Elevate Labs just gave me the bog standard response and refused to give me a refund, despite me not having used the app or authorized any charges.

One year is a long time to remember to stop it, but not even a alert a day or so before to make sure you don't pay 75â¬ for another year without asking.

"This should be the gold standard for apps. Besides the fact that the and the ui/ux is really clean and functional, I love the way the they handle payment. Free year no bs and they are transparent with the pricing and even tell you to not forget to cancel if you end up not being interested, most apps pray you forget so they can milk some more money outta ya. The little questionnaire you fill to personalize your feed is great, i got to medidation 2 minutes after installing. Well deserved 5 star","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Payment handling, UI/UX, Questionnaire for personalization, Guided sessions, Free trial period, Transparent pricing"
"There's definitely some kind of a bug. When I go to sign up for the free trial it doesn't utilize the Google Play account that I downloaded the app from, nor that I signed up with, but another of the accounts on my phone that I don't want to use. I've never had this issue with a Google Play app. How am I downloading it under one account and it's somehow looking for payment from an account that I didn't even download it from? Another frustrating app.","Review -> Free Trial, Google Play Account Integration, Payment Processing"
"When I saw the ad for a free year I wanted it to be true. Well, it is and it isn't. I am disabled, homeless, and have been couch surfing for two years. The mental health programs in my area are a joke. I can't even consider paying anything for a mental health app at this time. I was excited to learn about Balance. Unfortunately free still means you have to give them a pay method. Nope. It is up to YOU to remember to cancel before the year is up. Memory issues are part of mental health issues. â¹ï¸","Review -> Free Trial, Payment Method, Subscription Model, Cancellation Policy"
"Here's what happens when you install the app. It asks you a bunch of questions about your goals, then for a donation, which you can say Â£0 because it's not all about money (honest) then you create an account to unlock a free year. Then the only way to proceed is give payment details and it will take over Â£60 from you a year from today if you don't remember to cancel the subscription. Uninstalled. Im stressed out about everyone trying to extract money from me. Another money grabbing app. Avoid","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Subscription-based model"
"I've been using Balance for close to a year now, which also means my free trial time is coming to an end soon. I use it often to help me sleep and it always succeeds. I'm not sure why it's taken me so long but I've only just started using the app's other features, like daily meditation. I probably will continue to use this app, even if it means paying for a subscription. It's become quite an integral part of my bedtime process, which I suppose was the whole point of a year-long trial.","Review -> Sleep meditations, Daily meditation, Bedtime relaxation exercises"
"Hopeless. It can try and create a report after use for over 24 hours. Often have to restart phone to get it working. Also didn't know I was about to pay for this, thought i had cancelled it. Got an email saying I could unregister after they took another annual payment. Content is ok hence not a 1 star. Sometimes listen on way to sleep. Hopefully my unsubscribe has now worked and don't get charged again next year.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Sleep meditations, Payment and Subscription system, App stability and performance"
"It's probably the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health and well-being for day to day life. I have major trust issues with self help apps, so I waited a couple years before even posting a review.. I use it multiple times a day, every day. I am really grateful for the developers for creating this resource that doesn't bombard people with advertisements even after subscribing. This app is truly a gem.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Ad-free experience, Guided sessions, Meditation skills development, Breathing exercises, Sleep meditations"
"Classic bait and switch. App is advertised as being free but in reality you must pay $69.99/year to access all of the programs and options. Without paying the app is limited. Downloaded for sleep and found the two free programs unhelpful and the voice leading the programs slightly creepy tbh. Now I am trying to delete my account and it is not easy on Android. Big waste of time, I will be going to YouTube or Spotify for this kind of content in the future.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Sleep meditations, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)"
"I tried to unlock the year trial, it makes you agree to paying in 1 year time, so no cost todag right? Wrong. They tried to charge my card so it was declined, had i have known it was going to charge my card i wouldnt have done it right now but it wasnt clear at all, or maybe i just didnt see it.

It then switches input methods, without a lesson, to ""tap on the right"". The right of what? Button? Screen? The peaceful balanced rock logo? Something I touched went to the next screen, but I was still on the first, not knowing what to do. Or did. Maybe it,s a ploy to get anxious people to quit. It worked.

"Still no help from their support team after they said that has responded. Not happy with the support provided so far. ---- The app is decent but I'm giving it a low star because they over charge me. Even though I have a lifetime membership, they charged me an additional annual fee. I reached out to Google and they won't refund my fee. I reached out to the Balance app support and didn't get any reply. Not happy about this service.","Review 1 -> Support team, Lifetime membership, Annual fee, Refund policy

"It crashed on the home screen when i first tried to open it, ( it eventually let me in). Now I'm trying to look at the packages available for your app and it won't let me in, it tells me there's a problem with both my home and mobile Internet (not at all likely as everything else is working fine online). Needs fixing. BTW my mobile phone is a brand new s22 so it can't be that either. Update it finally at up an account, once I've given it the once over I'll be looking into contributing.","Review -> Login/Authentication, Package/Premium Content, Internet Connectivity, Account Creation"
"I have been using the app for over 6 months now and I must say the practice has given significant results in my life..! Great work guys ð. Just one thing to add, if you could add a 10-day plan on practice of law of attraction or Maybe a single on visualisation or something of that kind, it would be really really helpful. Other than that everything is awesome!","Review -> 10-day Plans, Singles"
"I love this app - the sleep tracks are super helpful with insomnia. My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a playlist option, so I could play a Fall Asleep singles session immediate followed by a selected Sleep Sounds track so I don't have to open the phone to get to that longer session.","I love this app - the sleep tracks are super helpful with insomnia.

"Update: The issue seemed to be related to a family member on my Google Family account had already taken advantage of the free year. They sent me a link to try it free. So far, I really like it. It was supposed to be free for a year, but the app wants $70. Edit: I did contact support and received a canned response saying it's only for new customers. When I responded that I am a new customer, I received a response with the exact same canned reply. It appears that AI does their customer service.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Free trial"

"I used this app for 2 nights and bought a lifetime membership! All I can say is, if you are having trouble sleeping, this is app is a game changer! Drift off to sleep and stay asleep with this wonderful app! I've used other apps in the past for meditative sleep etc and the voice got on my nerves and kept waking me up! You will not have that problem with this app! It's amazing! I slept better in the last two nights than I have in the last 5 years. Honestly! Try it!

"I would like to draw your attention to an issue I'm facing with this app. When I start a session, the audio does not comes out. Just the time and the bar keeps playing without the audio. In a session when there are two audio to be played, then some times one audio comes and sometimes another one. They don't come at the same time. Kindly look into this, else the app really great.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, Guided audio sessions, Audio library of sounds and meditation music, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)"
"Tapping on, or just simply touching my earbuds by accident stops the sound/music. But there is no way to resume the sound by tapping again like every other app. It makes me stop my meditation or relaxation to pick up my phone and open the app, then click the play button. That's not good.

"ive only used it for two days but already think ive done something really special for myself by getting this. would never have done it if it wasnt for the free 1-year trial but if it goes just like this, i may just be ready to pay for the next year! absolutely love how the programme is personalised at each step and reflects the progress up to that point. makes me feel like i am being coached by a real person!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises"
"This app has really helped me especially with the way it's structured & the multitude of options available depending on your needs and feelings in a particular moment. I paid a nominal figure for the free first year because it's already leaps and bounds better than what Calm and Headspace offers. The other 2 seem more focused on $, rather than providing a genuinely helpful service for people who may be in a dire emergency and $ is not at the forefront of their mind. Very thankful for this app!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Variety of options (meditation music, breathing exercises, sounds)"

"Disappointing they ask for a payment method to get the FREE version for a year before even letting you try out (or even see the basics of) the app. This reminds me of scams that REFUSE to cancel subscriptions after the ""free trial"" period ends. (THIS APP has reviews complaining of this happening). Developer responses ""addressing"" this complaint blame Google for the issue claiming it is their protocol to require it- NOT TRUE!","Review -> Free Trial, Subscription Management, Payment Method Requirement"
"Right after the welcome screen that asks you things like age , the first thing that pops is that they want your money. There is an option for 1 year free which sounds amazing but truely is a sly way to subscribe with your credit card and be sure to forget it in a year. And that is even without being able to even see what are we paying for, which is preposterous.

"Thanks This app has helped a lot and taught just much too. I'm in advanced 4, on a 42 day streak and I've had the app for 4-5 months. (Just so you the ammount of familiarity I have as a user, not bragging (still proudð)). Only thing I would say is that the achievement are a bit cruel and too far apart from each other and not good to incentivate people to keep the streak. I'm 3-4 stars down the list, and to go from 1 month streak to 1 year is a bit too much. I would do 1 month -3 - 5 -8 - 12. ie",Review -> Streaks and Achievements system
"Started skeptical about free year, if it's free you are the product... Day two and I'm strongly considering lifetime plan while it's on sale. Good practice at being able to calm your mind and body. Like all things, we need practice/habit to keep going. I'm looking at this like the opposite of a gym membership. Instead of sign up for a year, and you keep paying if you slack and then quit, it's have a free year, we're sure you'll stay after that.","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Sleep meditations, Lifetime plan"
"Why does every app someone could desperately use cost money? I get it takes work, time, and money to create, however sometimes people with one income can't afford this even when it's free for a year, your still asking either way $0-$50 pick $0 you end up having only the trial which is 3 days usually, sorry I just think sometimes everyone deserves to download a very useful app completely free!","Review -> Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Sleep meditations, Sleep stories, Sleep sounds

"Couldn't start. I don't feel comfortable sharing my card or payment information, So I hated that the app asked before I started. How am I to know if the app is safe or if I'm comfortable with it if it's asking me for banking details? It was very disappointing, plus the idea of me exploring this app was to reduce stress, not make me worry more! There are a lot of scams out there. Not saying this is one, but this type of ""free trial if you give us your banking details"" is a red flag to me.","Review -> Free Trial, Payment Information, Subscription Model"
"I like how Balance gives a free trial year in pure altruism for your mental wellbeing, especially notting that hussling money out of peeps is not a motivation. However, on the main screen a limited time offer is shown to purchase a lifelong sub for a great discount. And seeing it does not help to have a mental rest. To be consistent with the stated motivation it could be offered at the end of the trial. If peeps like the app they would heavely consider. Aside from that looks good.

Maybe it's all apps I've tried before that helped me to understand what this one is teaching, but in any way I'm staying with this one for a while.
