Review: Lots of outstanding bugs that people have complained about in Google forums for years just never get fixed! The way different homes get conflated makes it confusing. It's difficult to debug routines, because as much as the speakers babble when something goes wrong (often ad nauseam), they usually don't say which command or device is causing troubleÃ¢ÂÂI really wish I could just write code! I also wish I could arrange rooms in the order I want, group lights, and create shortcuts personal routines.
