"(EDIT) it's 100 bucks a year now?? ð WITH a discount, otherwise it's 200 bucks?? Are you all tripping? The concept is great but I do not understand why being able to check items off from the previous day is a function locked behind a paywall. Especially when the calendar changes at midnight on the dot, that means I'm constantly unable to register what I've done during the day just because I've completed a task at 00:30am. I'm not going to pay 35 bucks just for that function, it's absurd.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Time Management, Self-Awareness"
"It seems like a great app if you want to pay. The concept is great, it explores all aspects of your life to help you improve them all. However, 90% is behind a paywall of about $40 a month. I find it funny that one topic is financial frustrations, and yet... have another bill to deal with it. I'd much rather put up with ads than pay what they're asking for some simple help with life goals. I can write it out on paper for free.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Financial Management (indirectly mentioned as ""financial frustrations"")"
"Originally this was great! It had a lot of free help that was beneficial and at one point I switched to premium to benefit myself more. Some life events caused me to drop the less necessary costs in my life and I'm stable again and now it seems that every goal available is only premium. This is terrible for marketing because you can no longer sample the goals they offer and prepare for you. Now, there's very little you can do without paying.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Free/Premium Content, Sampling of Goals"
"This idea is fantastic, and i would use it non stop. But I think the cost for a subscription is kind of ridiculous. If it was cheaper I think that I would do it. The amount of free stuff is very limited so you kind of have to pay to do anything. It's a great idea, but I'm not paying 12 dollars a month for it... Im tempted, but that's too expensive. I think this app would still make a good profit without having to pay, and as annoying as ads are, it's much better than having to pay monthly","Review -> Subscription Model, Free Content Limitations, Advertisements, Monthly Payment"
I'm sure it's a great app for people who have more time than I do. I wish I could utilize the benefits of the app but it's too much content too many choices just too much I can't spend the time navigating through it to find out how exactly to use it I would say simplify it maybe offer a simplified version? it's just not the right app for me.,"Review -> Simplified User Interface, Content Overload Management, Easy Navigation, User Onboarding Process"
"This is a great app, I like the features and the goals. I'm on the free version and I get that you can't plan that far ahead because it's a premium feature. However I think seeing the things you have already added to the app you should be able to do for FREE. I would understand if we couldn't add to the past or edit past entries. But not seeing them at all I think is really point less. Would have given this app a 5 if I was just able to look at the past entries I have made.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Viewing Past Entries"
"I agree with the previous user. Seems like it could be a valuable app but I want to know up front if it's free or not instead of downloading the app, having to create an account then get hit with the pricing before I can continue using the app. Theres no point in being deceptive (not sure if that was the intent or not) but it's always better to let ppl know up front if there is a charge involved instead of them having to find out on the back end.","Review -> Pricing Transparency, Free Trial/Version, Account Creation, In-App Purchases"
"Insanely expensive upgrade LOL! Not possible for normal people to afford! I'm in US. UNINSTALLED! // PAST: It prompted me for the 1st time, I spent at least half an hour & a great deal of thought - time I didn't really have typing in my reasons for my mood of today. Then it didn't save anything I typed. It only saves replied to its prompt if I subscribe, yet it didn't inform me of that?? Not happy so far. No free pro trial, so I'm unable to see if I like it or not?","Review -> Free Trial, Subscription Model, Data Saving, Prompt Feature, Affordability"
"Bought the full version on sale, can say that its actually helped me in times of high stress and would definitely recommend someone buy it. Like all apps, after a month theres a lull where you don't feel like checking in anymore but i notice thats when I need it the most. Great app. Not sure if they add more classes or thats it, i dont think the app makes it clear. Still good amount of courses, worth the money imo.","Review -> Stress Management, Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Courses"
"I would give this app 5* if you could see your past journal in the free version or the cost of premium was about half what it is now. â¢The devs offered me a one week trial which I appreciated, so I changed from 3* to 4*, but my day doesn't end at midnight and not being able to change that is a dealbreaker for me. â¢The subscription page at the beginning is also misleading, it looks like you can't skip it even though you can. I KNEW I could skip it and I almost missed the little x in the corner.","Review -> Journaling, Subscription Model, Customizable Day End Time, User Interface (Subscription Page)"
"Awful. The previous version of the app was awesome - so good, been using it for ages - will now not be subscribing. Hideous new interface, difficult to use, super clunky - got to fill out things in the mood thing then go back to the journal thing. Horrible, time consuming, and actually a bit ugly, totally overpriced. You RUINED it. Turn it baaaack! I rely on this so much but only use a small part of it. Happy to pay for just that. Really upset.","Review -> Mood Tracker, Journal, Goal Achievement, Customization/Payment Options"
The customer service is great and it's a nifty app that has a great UI and does what it does well. It's just really annoying though for forgetting I'm a premium user. I paid for it via a link given by the app (for a reduced fee) but now I find I keep having to ask customer support. It then seems to be resolved only for it to be taken away again. It's an experience not all customers will go through but it's just been seemingly going in circles somewhat,"Review -> Payment Processing, User Account Management, Customer Support, Premium User Features"
"Love the look of the new update! And the developer is such a nice person :) (I told him the word ""resources"" in the menu doesn't quite fit on my phone screen - the ""s"" at the end puts itself on a new line which looks odd - and he emailed back to say he's gonna fix it! They've taken on previous feedback/ideas I've given too which is so cool!) But yeh love the app and so happy you've changed the headings to include day of month and date!","Review -> Menu, Headings, Date Display, Goal Achievement, Feedback Mechanism, User Interface"
"At the start I would have given it 5 stars. I actually really enjoyed the daily video session and that's what made me sign up in the first place. I'm now a couple of months in and the video sessions have stopped, I just get a quote instead. I've unsubscribed and annoyed I had to pay for the whole year already and the main reason I got it (the short daily video) is now no longer there.",Review -> Daily Video Sessions
"This is the worst self help app I have ever come across. because the content is good, overall experience is superb, but everything (yes, even the most basic ""getting started"" courses) are behind a paywall. when quizzed on why is this the case, the support agent lied and said some of them are free but when I checked, not a single course in the highlighted courses is free. i would give it 5 stars if you gave enough value in free plan. Instead you guys lied to me and frustated the hell out of me.","Review -> Courses, Free Plan, Paywall, Getting Started Courses, Support Agent, Highlighted Courses"
"If you have executive dysfunction issues, give this one a miss. Came back to this app after using it a couple of years ago, and I could not even get through the first Daily Remente session: it's a video that you can't skip, rewind, or speed up, with a presenter who seems absolutely lovely but talks very slowly and deliberately. I have no idea what she was trying to tell me, I can't find a way to switch to a transcript or text-only mode (there are subtitles but they're so slow it's even worse.)","Review -> Daily Remente session, Video playback control (skip, rewind, speed up), Transcript or text-only mode"
"Having completed the initial questionnaire, I was then asked to sign up for a premuim membership. Although that screen had the option to dismiss it, it didn't work and I couldn't get into the app to try it out. It doesn't look like a subscription is mandatory but, unless that screen can be dismissed, it might as well be, and I'm not paying Â£12 to try out an app that might not do what I need it to.","Review -> Free Trial, Subscription Model, Mandatory Payment, Dismiss Option, App Accessibility"
purchased the premium version and was sadly disappointed. the resources are ok but not great and in my opinion badly narrated. the app kept crashing while trying to write in the journal to the point that I had to restart my phone. massively over priced. also customer support sucks as I didn't even get a reply about the crashing issue. subscription cancelled!,"Review -> Journal, Resources, Customer Support, Subscription Management, App Stability"
"Hi, I really like Remente. However, lately it is getting more and more annoying because of the frequent crashes. It happens ever since the last visual update (plus I prefered the previous one, I found it more user friendly). Please, do something about it. Thank you!","Review -> Stability/Performance, User Interface"
"I honestly didn't get very far. Any app that forces you to sign up for regular payments before you have a chance to see what it is about automatically gets deleted. If you're forcing payment, make people pay for the app before they download it. This might be great but I've had bad experiences, so will no longer touch any app that begins by starting a paid subscription for you. 1 star because it feels like I was being manipulated within 20 seconds of loading the app.","Review -> Subscription Model, Free Trial/Payment Gateway"
Really good app no matter how many times I uninstalled it I just find myself installing it again.. The features are great but one thing disturbing me is that can you also add a habit feature (or is there one already?) with offline feature cause it's a hassle to always connect to the internet specially in our area where it's too costly to have internet at times,"Review -> Habit Feature, Offline Feature, Goal Achievement, Building Good Habits"
"Can't do anything without a premium account. Uninstalled this app ages ago and I keep getting emails from them, but whenever I try to unsubscribe it takes me to an error page and the link on that page to report the issue takes me to some other random website that has nothing to do with this and I'm sick and tired of these emails!!!! Leave me alone!","Review -> Unsubscription process, Premium account requirements, Email management"
"I enjoy the app with all its features, but I have opted for a monthly premium subscription. The payment has gone through but I just receive an error saying ""Your order is processing, your item will be available in a few minutes."" its been like that for 2 days. Please assist and if it's resolved I will change my rating to 5 star.","Review -> Payment Processing, Subscription Management"
"Great app! I dont know about the long term benefits just yet but I've been updating it regularly. However, everytime I open it a second time it doesn't load and I have to shut it down from the background apps and reopen. A little frustrating but this app comes from a good place. Thank you!","Review -> App Launch/Loading, Background App Management, Regular Updates"
"Instantly uninstalled because the free content is poor. Just want to find a good self help app that doesnt cost the earth , or at least one that has decent free content and doesnt immediately shove the premium content in your face. We can't all afford to pay for apps like this especially when they are so overpriced","Review -> Free Content, Premium Content, Pricing, In-App Purchases, Free Trial/Version"
"Exciting concept, disappointing outcome. Put it on 5 iOS and Android devices, created a basic account and seeing nothing to the contrary left to assume syncing was built in (have yet to see a settings resource for any such purpose). opening screen jumps right in and later I realize that nothing showed up on my other devices, wrote to support about five hours ago and don't even know it they received it. one reviewer said something like 'great app but overwhelmed support.' That is my thinking too.","Review -> Syncing across devices, Support, Settings resource"
"Hi. I was really happy to download this app and it was great withnthe setup of the app, butnthen in less then a week things got locked and now everyting needs to be paid. I can now only use it mood. Its great,but im not spending money to unlock things that were open before just because they want money. I would recommend but be on the watch. Nce app, changes fast.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Mood Management"
"Remente has many pay-to-access features which may turn some off, but there are still many things to do for free. I wouldn't normally pay for an app like this, but I think I might soon make an exception. The app has helped me to lose weight and be more confident, which is what I know many of us are looking for. In doubt? Try the app. See if it's for you.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Weight Loss"
Its been super helpful to me in many ways! i would give in five stars if the free version would at least let you plan for the next day. Im choosing to upgrade anyway and but the premium but i would have bought it sooner if I was allowed to plan a day ahead and experience the feeling of being prepared as well as the feeling of accomplishment,"Review -> Goal Achievement, Time Management, Planning"
I think this app has the potential to be great but I can't get a free trial and I'm afraid I'm not really that into paying Â£12.99 a month. It's a bit high to be honest. I really like the concept and would have definitely subscribed if it was cheaper but I can't justify the price. Shame.,"Review -> Free Trial, Pricing"
"I love the app so far except one BIG thing! Access to my own personal data! Once I logged things, everything that is in the past is locked behind a paywall! I understand locking the future days behind a paywall but it shouldn't be the case with what I have personally written!! I want my notes back!","Review -> Data Export/Access, Subscription Model, Note-Taking/Journaling Feature"
"I paid the $75 upfront instead of the subscription, because I hate having subscriptions. Anyway though, it's definitely worth it. It's the first time I've actually kept up with updating a self help app. It's easy to use and I like the tracking. Would recommend.","Review -> Tracking, Easy to use, Updating a self help app, Goal Achievement"
I haven't had the chance to really explore this app because it crashed so often and I find I can't use it for the entire day. It'll crash one day and work the next which makes it very unreliable for working in long term plans and self improvement.,"Review -> Stability/Reliability, Long-term Planning"
"would be great but had to get rid of it. it does not stop sending notifications! I get them all through the day at work and non stop at home, I sometimes get a notification from the app followed immediately by an email from it saying the same thing",Review -> Notifications feature
"After the intro, it wouldn't let me get past the Premium subscription window. No matter how much I press the X button, or restart it, I still cannot get past it. I mean, I will not pay money first BEFORE i even get to see what the app is about. So, sorry. Uninstalling.","Review -> Free Trial or Demo, Subscription Model, Intro or Onboarding Process"
"cool concept but way too pushy with the over priced ""premium account"". All of the somewhat cool goals/resources are locked unless you want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for an app. it's a cool idea but unless you plan to fork out money it's a waste of space app.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Premium Account"
"None of the plans or goals seemed very targeted, all very vague life style magazine like. The better ones seem all premium. UI is pretty but poorly thought out and likely hasn't been tested outside of the dev team as it's very unintuative in places","Review -> Goal Achievement, User Interface, Content Quality, Premium Features"
"Full of grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and spelling mistakes. I was too distracted by it to get much out of the app. I think the app has potential and may be on to something, but the many errors makes one question the credibility of the authors.","Review -> Content Quality, Credibility of Authors, Overall User Experience"
"Edit: Was finally able to get into the app, not to try it out ð Is this a premium only app? I can't get past the beginning screen that prompts you to buy the premium, extremely annoying. When I try and hit the X to get out it doesn't work, and even when I hit the buy button it doesn't work and I'm just stuck on that Damn screen.","Review -> Premium Subscription, Navigation/Onboarding, Payment Processing, Free Trial/Version"
"Great app, the concept of converting goals to to-do lists is amazing, but it bugs a lot. Often changes and entries don't show until I close and reopen the app. Subscription keeps getting cancelled.","Review -> Goal Achievement, Subscription Management, Data Persistence"

"Used to like this app very much but now it stucks in a white blank page saying ""Remente cannot run without an up-to-date version of google play services."" I Googled it and fixed this issue by clearing play services cache and storage data. But after a week..here we go again and this method is not working for me anymore.","Review -> None (The review mentions an issue with Google Play Services, which is not a feature of the Remente app itself, but rather a dependency)"
"In more recent times, Remente keeps stopping as soon as I try to open it. This makes it unusable unless the app is reinstalled, but even then this keeps happening and I end up having to reinstall it again. It's a good app, but only when you can actually use it. Deveopers, please do something about this.","Review -> App Launch/Startup, Stability/Reliability"
"I actually really enjoy this app. I look forward to using this app. I just wish it was a bit cheaper to access the premium, because I sooooo would buy it.

"BE OPEN ABOUT PREMIUM. There's no free (or obviously free) content. It's premium only. Some of the app's content is very basic and involves downloading other apps.

I have downloaded this app just 2 days ago. I liked its idea thats why I have applied for premium subscription & completed the payment procedure yesterday.

"Great way to set goals and stay on track! I really wish that there wasn't as much of the app locked behind premium. other than that, you can plan your current day, set goals, read certain resourse lessons, and select certain preset goals already made on the app. You can also rate the balance of different aspects in your life to help you see which ones need work. There is so much more you can do with this app if you have the money for premium.","Review -> Goal Setting, Daily Planning, Resource Lessons, Preset Goals, Life Balance Assessment, Premium Features"
"I have tried and tried again to find a way to get back on track after a very long, MDD episode (clinical Major Depressive Disorder)... And I found this app, this amazing app! I paid for the premium after the first month of usage; yes, I feel that it is worth it for all that it does actually do. However, I still feel it is just a little bit more expensive then I would like. But again, for all that it does and what you can learn, what you can enact within your daily life, and all that you can do throughout the programs and courses... I pretty much will keep paying the monthly charge until I can truly invest in myself fully! Sadly, I stopped taking proper care of myself for that one month I had already paid for, but I can honestly say, that it's on me and that I wasn't very active, let alone BE proactive, during my really tough times. The point of this long-winded journey is, is that this app is totally worth it for free and the premium version definitely has a lot more programs to help you better yourself. I wouldn't pay for the premium until you were sure you were ready to ""be about it, not talk about it..."" In other words, unless you are absolutely sure that you are truly ready for your own, mostly customizable, journey inwards with yourself and ready to take your life back, hold off paying for the premium version. Because, if you're not ready to do the work, then that monthly, yearly, lifetime subscription will not be worth a single penny. But, please do actually give this a 100% true try and see results in yourself (and even those around you) that perhaps you haven't seen in quite some time. Aannnddd, one more thing.... Absolutely do enjoy yourself while changing, altering, and taking back control of your own life, once and for all! Hint: For this app to truly work for you, you must truly put in a lot of hard work for yourself... And if this is what you've been looking for, then you totally deserve the outcome that will come with hard work and a giant pay-off!

"I really like this app. I like how customizable it is. You can create your own goals using your own pictures. It breaks down goals into small steps, making bigger goals seem more achievable. I took off 1 star just because the cost of premium is a lot. I would pay that for lifetime use, but not per year. I don't think I'll renew premium next year unless it's half the price.

"I've used Remente for a few years now and it's been the best app I've downloaded. It's one of the few apps I transfer from cellphone to cellphone. I found this gem while looking for goal setting/accountability apps and I've not been disappointed. There are built-in goals designed for the more common or popular requests, such as finances or health. You can also design your own. Remente helps break down the goal into tasks, complete with deadlines and reminders, making large goals less daunting. Small steps kept me on track this year and I am on course to achieving multiple goals by the the end of the year. I'm already considering next year! Need inspiration? The app also has videos to help you along your journey. Written and designed by professionals, the mini courses offer good advice to help achieve your goals and get things done. Better still, support staff is quick to respond with questions or issues that pop up. If you're trying to get your act together, having trouble finishing what you start, or finding a good place to start, Remente is the go-to app!","Review -> Goal Setting, Accountability, Task Management, Deadline and Reminder System, Customizable Goals, Video Courses, Support Staff

Love it! One suggestion I have is to sync the Goals to the Life Balance chart.

Then for each goal you can create small steps to follow, as well as having a journal for each goal is extremely important to me. It hekps keep track with progress and I love it!

Please make it easier to review entries by adding hashtags or categories. 4. Add photo database. 5. Add auto back-up function.","1.

"I love this app!!!! I get to plan my day out,and at night it gives me reminders to tell the app how my day was. you get about five choices on how you feel. Based sad to happy. Then you also get to pick more choices on how you feel. Like you could say your stressed,tired,lonely on the negative side or happy,positive,calm etc. on the positive side. It gives you courses to go though to help get your life together. you can write Down your feelings like a diary.And you can set goals.I recommend it!","Review -> Day Planning, Mood Tracking, Emotional State Tracking, Courses, Diary, Goal Setting"
"These past weeks I've been reviewing top-rated apps that can help against procrastination and none is perfect so I'm designing mine. Remente is definitely the one inspiring me the most, especially the rate-your-mood-and-explain-why feature. Other apps better handle to-do lists (Todoist), commitment to goals (stickK) or timing/pomodoro stuff (Productivity Challenge Timer, Forest). But what really keeps me coming back to Remente is that I'm led to input personal thoughts and that feels engaging !","Review -> rate-your-mood-and-explain-why, to-do lists, commitment to goals, timing/pomodoro

I love the visual representation and various resources that help with being balanced in every spectrum of life. It helps me put things into perspective and utilize techniques that they teach in therapy and books about anexity. 10/10 would recomend !,"Review -> Visual Representation, Goal Achievement, Stress Management, Self-Awareness"
"It is definitely so much more than I thought it could be. It is very unobtrusive while still being encouraging. It is pretty easy to use and I like that there are keywords for mood logging so that you are helped along in being more specific on your mood states--I found this to be very mindful and caused me to put more thought into my feelings and the reasons behind them, as well as take time to appreciate them. Pricing is fair. May be worth upgrading even though money is tight.","Review -> Mood Logging, Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Mindfulness Tools"
"2 years later and I'm writing a new review. The premium gets in the way, of course, and knowing you have to pay your way to good mental health is kinda wack, BUT, it is what it is, and I think the free version is wonderful. Really helping me - I even told my therapist about it. Would recommend :)","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Stress Management"
"when i first started using the app i had trouble. once i used the resources my emotion changed on it. yo this is a good app. even the free version has helped me out. id suggest using the insight chart before you start journaling and creating goals. always work om your weak areas. you will never delete this app. using the insight will help you figure out why you may be feeling sad, lonely or depressed. It will show you if you really want friends and a social life. maybe you want to be loved.","Review -> Insight Chart, Journaling, Goal Creation, Stress Management, Self-Awareness, Emotional Management"
"It gave me step by step guides and suggestions on how I could work on things to better my daily life! It broke everything down so it made it simple, easy to achieve and understand! And it was amazing to me, that it managed to pinpoint exactly what I needed with the little information I gave it. Cheers to whoever made this!","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Time Management, Decision Making"
"My life is in chaos! I know a lot of it is making bad choices. So I decided to try this app. It was a bit complicated, but once I began to understand it, the key is being able to view your past, so you could see how far you've come. That's when they spring on you the fees you have to pay for that info. In other words, they take the appearance that they care about you and the details of your life, which is a lie, they want your money! (All these apps get the money they need with all the ads).","Review -> Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Viewing past progress"
"Definitely recommend it 100% for setting personal goals and helping maintain a steady emotional balance.
