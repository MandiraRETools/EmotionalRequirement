"(EDIT) it's 100 bucks a year now?? 😂 WITH a discount, otherwise it's 200 bucks?? Are you all tripping? The concept is great but I do not understand why being able to check items off from the previous day is a function locked behind a paywall. Especially when the calendar changes at midnight on the dot, that means I'm constantly unable to register what I've done during the day just because I've completed a task at 00:30am. I'm not going to pay 35 bucks just for that function, it's absurd.",edit 100 buck year discount otherwise 200 buck tripping concept great understand able check item previous day function locked behind paywall especially calendar change midnight dot mean im constantly unable register ive done day ive completed task 0030am im going pay 35 buck function absurd,1
"It seems like a great app if you want to pay. The concept is great, it explores all aspects of your life to help you improve them all. However, 90% is behind a paywall of about $40 a month. I find it funny that one topic is financial frustrations, and yet... have another bill to deal with it. I'd much rather put up with ads than pay what they're asking for some simple help with life goals. I can write it out on paper for free.",seems like great app want pay concept great explores aspect life help improve however 90 behind paywall 40 month find funny one topic financial frustration yet another bill deal id much rather put ad pay theyre asking simple help life goal write paper free,1
"Originally this was great! It had a lot of free help that was beneficial and at one point I switched to premium to benefit myself more. Some life events caused me to drop the less necessary costs in my life and I'm stable again and now it seems that every goal available is only premium. This is terrible for marketing because you can no longer sample the goals they offer and prepare for you. Now, there's very little you can do without paying.",originally great lot free help beneficial one point switched premium benefit life event caused drop less necessary cost life im stable seems every goal available premium terrible marketing longer sample goal offer prepare there little without paying,1
"This idea is fantastic, and i would use it non stop. But I think the cost for a subscription is kind of ridiculous. If it was cheaper I think that I would do it. The amount of free stuff is very limited so you kind of have to pay to do anything. It's a great idea, but I'm not paying 12 dollars a month for it... Im tempted, but that's too expensive. I think this app would still make a good profit without having to pay, and as annoying as ads are, it's much better than having to pay monthly",idea fantastic would use non stop think cost subscription kind ridiculous cheaper think would amount free stuff limited kind pay anything great idea im paying 12 dollar month im tempted thats expensive think app would still make good profit without pay annoying ad much better pay monthly,1
I'm sure it's a great app for people who have more time than I do. I wish I could utilize the benefits of the app but it's too much content too many choices just too much I can't spend the time navigating through it to find out how exactly to use it I would say simplify it maybe offer a simplified version? it's just not the right app for me.,im sure great app people time wish could utilize benefit app much content many choice much cant spend time navigating find exactly use would say simplify maybe offer simplified version right app,1
"This is a great app, I like the features and the goals. I'm on the free version and I get that you can't plan that far ahead because it's a premium feature. However I think seeing the things you have already added to the app you should be able to do for FREE. I would understand if we couldn't add to the past or edit past entries. But not seeing them at all I think is really point less. Would have given this app a 5 if I was just able to look at the past entries I have made.",great app like feature goal im free version get cant plan far ahead premium feature however think seeing thing already added app able free would understand couldnt add past edit past entry seeing think really point less would given app 5 able look past entry made,1
"I agree with the previous user. Seems like it could be a valuable app but I want to know up front if it's free or not instead of downloading the app, having to create an account then get hit with the pricing before I can continue using the app. Theres no point in being deceptive (not sure if that was the intent or not) but it's always better to let ppl know up front if there is a charge involved instead of them having to find out on the back end.",agree previous user seems like could valuable app want know front free instead downloading app create account get hit pricing continue using app there point deceptive sure intent always better let ppl know front charge involved instead find back end,1

"Bought the full version on sale, can say that its actually helped me in times of high stress and would definitely recommend someone buy it. Like all apps, after a month theres a lull where you don't feel like checking in anymore but i notice thats when I need it the most.

"I would give this app 5* if you could see your past journal in the free version or the cost of premium was about half what it is now. •The devs offered me a one week trial which I appreciated, so I changed from 3* to 4*, but my day doesn't end at midnight and not being able to change that is a dealbreaker for me. •The subscription page at the beginning is also misleading, it looks like you can't skip it even though you can.

"Awful. The previous version of the app was awesome - so good, been using it for ages - will now not be subscribing. Hideous new interface, difficult to use, super clunky - got to fill out things in the mood thing then go back to the journal thing.

The customer service is great and it's a nifty app that has a great UI and does what it does well. It's just really annoying though for forgetting I'm a premium user. I paid for it via a link given by the app (for a reduced fee) but now I find I keep having to ask customer support. It then seems to be resolved only for it to be taken away again. It's an experience not all customers will go through but it's just been seemingly going in circles somewhat,customer service great nifty app great ui well really annoying though forgetting im premium user paid via link given app reduced fee find keep ask customer support seems resolved taken away experience customer go seemingly going circle somewhat,1
"Love the look of the new update! And the developer is such a nice person :) (I told him the word ""resources"" in the menu doesn't quite fit on my phone screen - the ""s"" at the end puts itself on a new line which looks odd - and he emailed back to say he's gonna fix it!

"At the start I would have given it 5 stars. I actually really enjoyed the daily video session and that's what made me sign up in the first place.

"This is the worst self help app I have ever come across. because the content is good, overall experience is superb, but everything (yes, even the most basic ""getting started"" courses) are behind a paywall. when quizzed on why is this the case, the support agent lied and said some of them are free but when I checked, not a single course in the highlighted courses is free. i would give it 5 stars if you gave enough value in free plan. Instead you guys lied to me and frustated the hell out of me.",worst self help app ever come across content good overall experience superb everything yes even basic getting started course behind paywall quizzed case support agent lied said free checked single course highlighted course free would give 5 star gave enough value free plan instead guy lied frustated hell,1
"If you have executive dysfunction issues, give this one a miss. Came back to this app after using it a couple of years ago, and I could not even get through the first Daily Remente session: it's a video that you can't skip, rewind, or speed up, with a presenter who seems absolutely lovely but talks very slowly and deliberately.

Although that screen had the option to dismiss it, it didn't work and I couldn't get into the app to try it out.

"I honestly didn't get very far. Any app that forces you to sign up for regular payments before you have a chance to see what it is about automatically gets deleted.

Really good app no matter how many times I uninstalled it I just find myself installing it again.. The features are great but one thing disturbing me is that can you also add a habit feature (or is there one already?) with offline feature cause it's a hassle to always connect to the internet specially in our area where it's too costly to have internet at times,really good app matter many time uninstalled find installing feature great one thing disturbing also add habit feature one already offline feature cause hassle always connect internet specially area costly internet time,1

"Remente has many pay-to-access features which may turn some off, but there are still many things to do for free.

I think this app has the potential to be great but I can't get a free trial and I'm afraid I'm not really that into paying £12.99 a month. It's a bit high to be honest.

"I have tried and tried again to find a way to get back on track after a very long, MDD episode (clinical Major Depressive Disorder)... And I found this app, this amazing app! I paid for the premium after the first month of usage; yes, I feel that it is worth it for all that it does actually do. However, I still feel it is just a little bit more expensive then I would like. But again, for all that it does and what you can learn, what you can enact within your daily life, and all that you can do throughout the programs and courses... I pretty much will keep paying the monthly charge until I can truly invest in myself fully! Sadly, I stopped taking proper care of myself for that one month I had already paid for, but I can honestly say, that it's on me and that I wasn't very active, let alone BE proactive, during my really tough times. The point of this long-winded journey is, is that this app is totally worth it for free and the premium version definitely has a lot more programs to help you better yourself. I wouldn't pay for the premium until you were sure you were ready to ""be about it, not talk about it..."" In other words, unless you are absolutely sure that you are truly ready for your own, mostly customizable, journey inwards with yourself and ready to take your life back, hold off paying for the premium version. Because, if you're not ready to do the work, then that monthly, yearly, lifetime subscription will not be worth a single penny. But, please do actually give this a 100% true try and see results in yourself (and even those around you) that perhaps you haven't seen in quite some time. Aannnddd, one more thing.... Absolutely do enjoy yourself while changing, altering, and taking back control of your own life, once and for all! Hint: For this app to truly work for you, you must truly put in a lot of hard work for yourself...

There are many great things about this app and I can see myself using it for a long time. There are also some critical negatives however: 1.

"It has helped me a lot ( based on my past 4 months of usage) . I always have my day plan in front of me which helps me know when I'm wasting my time based on how much I've covered in the day.

"I WAS really enjoying the app, but then today, some of the tasks I had set to appear on sundays using the goals feature didn't show up... the whole point of me going through all the effort to assign certain tasks to certain days was so that I wouldn't have to remember what needed to be done each day; I'd just be able to do it. But now I'm going to be paranoid and have to double check that nothing is missing each day. I use the app for my work so it's very important that nothing gets missed",really enjoying app today task set appear sunday using goal feature didnt show whole point going effort assign certain task certain day wouldnt remember needed done day id able im going paranoid double check nothing missing day use app work important nothing get missed,0

This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something.

"These past weeks I've been reviewing top-rated apps that can help against procrastination and none is perfect so I'm designing mine. Remente is definitely the one inspiring me the most, especially the rate-your-mood-and-explain-why feature. Other apps better handle to-do lists (Todoist), commitment to goals (stickK) or timing/pomodoro stuff (Productivity Challenge Timer, Forest). But what really keeps me coming back to Remente is that I'm led to input personal thoughts and that feels engaging !",past week ive reviewing toprated apps help procrastination none perfect im designing mine remente definitely one inspiring especially rateyourmoodandexplainwhy feature apps better handle todo list todoist commitment goal stickk timingpomodoro stuff productivity challenge timer forest really keep coming back remente im led input personal thought feel engaging,0

"It is definitely so much more than I thought it could be. It is very unobtrusive while still being encouraging. It is pretty easy to use and I like that there are keywords for mood logging so that you are helped along in being more specific on your mood states--I found this to be very mindful and caused me to put more thought into my feelings and the reasons behind them, as well as take time to appreciate them. Pricing is fair. May be worth upgrading even though money is tight.",definitely much thought could unobtrusive still encouraging pretty easy use like keywords mood logging helped along specific mood statesi found mindful caused put thought feeling reason behind well take time appreciate pricing fair may worth upgrading even though money tight,0
