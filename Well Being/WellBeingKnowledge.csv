"day two and I'm already feeling the change in my stress level. free trial gave me access to everything so I haven't looked around and seen all that available, but so far, I'm VERY impressed by this app!! I'm already feeling less anxious and if I ever hit a panic attack, they have an SOS meditation guide for on the spot needs. I love this one so much, can't wait to see what all I can get accomplished as I strive towards a more stress free life! thank you devs so much for opening up the trial!!Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤","SOS meditation guide, Free trial, Personalized guided meditations, Animated breathing exercises",Positive
"I did the Balance one year free trial a few years ago but didn't manage to build a consistent habit and ended up trying a few apps that were either totally free or had a good number of free meditations. I ended up coming back to Balance and buying a lifetime membership and am meditating daily now. I like that each meditation adapts and that some gives options (like the Pomodoro session). I also like that everything is rooted in science and explanations are given, no esoterism to be found.","Personalized guided meditations, Adaptive meditations, Pomodoro session, Science-backed explanations, Lifetime membership",Positive
"Really great app. Love all the quiet options to relax for bed or have soothing white noise type things playing. Would be 5 stars if there were cast support. My kids love the sleep meditations, and I can use the media output settings built into my phone to play things on the Google speakers in their rooms, but it's clunky and disconnects all the time. Cast support would be great to set it and forget it so it's playing on its own and not relying on my phone. Other than that, I love it!","Sleep Meditations, Media Output Settings, Cast Support",Positive
"It would be good, if there was an option, to restart the meditation plans at any points, if I feel got lost with them, or repeat anytime in a later point in the future. Also there is a bug, if a fullscreen notification comes up, like a calendar reminder, will makes the meditation stop, and when recognising that it was stopped, and get the notification out of the way, the meditation would just start from the beginning, instead continue from the point it was disrupted.. Please resolve these.","10-day Plans, Guided Meditations, Meditation Sessions, Breathing Exercises, Singles

"I was diagnosed with dysautonomia (from covid) and have troubles with anxiety, tachycardia, blood pressure spikes, pvcs, fatigue, seeing/feeling/hearing my pulse, chest pain, pressure in chest, vertigo, vision blacking out, etc. I stumbled upon this app, and it has really helped me to reduce stress levels, raise my HRV, get a better night's sleep, gain more energy, and am able to switch back into parasympathetic much faster now. If you struggle with stress or sleep, I HIGHLY recommend Balance!","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Sleep meditations, Breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, Relax, Energize, and Concentrate daily guided meditations, Foundations Plan, Advanced Plan, Guided breathing exercises",Negative
I'm on Day 2 of the free 1-year trial. I love the guided meditation practices and the numerous categories that you can choose from. There's also an unguided option in case you don't or can't follow along with a guided session. It can be distracting for some people to hear someone throughout a 5- or 10-minute session. I've been going through a severe depressive episode and bouts of general anxiety. These last two sessions helped me to focus and mentally regroup. I can't wait to practice more.,"Guided Meditation Practices, Unguided Option, Categories for Meditation Sessions",Positive
"I have been looking for a good, efficient mental & emotional health company & app where I can truly feel the results and I don't have to stop & be limited because of subscription costs. although I agree with subscription costs in order ro run the company, staff & all things related to the app, it made it difficult for me to get healthy. but when I tried this company & their app, their kind yr long free subscription has truly helped & I just started last night. I am forever greatful. I recommend!","Free Subscription, Personalized Program",Positive
"I saw this was offered at a full year for free & I was immediately interested. Most apps give you, at most, 2 weeks free. I felt they must have faith in their product to offer that kind of promo. I've used it daily, 1-3 times per day, for 3 weeks. It is hands down the best meditation app I've ever used. I look forward to meditating instead of feeling like it's a chore or task to complete. I've gotten a few friends using it also. I'm hoping I'll be able to afford the lifetime discount plan.

"This is by far the BEST meditation app out there. I love all the singles, I love that in the ""breaking habits"" one if you select smoking they don't specifically say cigarettes in the meditation (I'm trying to quit weed). Ofosu has a very soothing voice and I love all the educational aspects. I got a whole year free trial and I try to use it every day. This is the only app that's actually helped me sustain a meditation habit, and I've tried a LOT of them. And there are NO ADS in the free version!","Singles, Breaking Habits meditation, Educational aspects, No Ads in free version, Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises",Positive
"I love this app!!! Due to undiagnosed ADHD, I stopped meditating due to my increasing inability to sit, focus, and enjoy the moment. I typically never gravitated towards guided meditation because the repetition was even worse. Balance has restored my meditation routine bc the meditation can be as little as 5 minutes, and you never get the same guided meditation twice!!!! That keeps me engaged and looking forward to the next one. I've gifted one year to so many ppl. You'll love it!","Personalized guided meditations, Bite-sized Singles, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises, Variety of guided meditation sessions",Positive
"I came into this with an open mind. No set expectations , just a curiosity and a willingness to try and to give it my all, no halfway effort. This has really made a complete positive change to my overall feeling mentally, physically and emotionally I feel better... I had played the exercises aloud and my friend wants to do this as well. The guide is amazing, his voice.is everything, his manner is positive and warm. How he connects and comes across reached me","Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, 10-day Plans, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations), Sleep meditations",Positive
The nightly meditations and the daily skills I'm learning to meditate even better. I feel more relaxed when ever I finish one. At night it never fails to put me to sleep. I like that the lessons are short because I don't always have a lot of time on my hands. The fact that I get to try it free for a year too is great. It gives me a chance to really decide whether it's something that will work to help lower my stress and help me to gain better focus throughout the day. Thank you Balance!!!,"Nightly meditations, Daily skills, Short lessons, Free trial, Sleep feature, Stress reduction, Focus improvement",Positive
"Lovely, generous. Adaptive to whatever your needs are. Personalized to each individual and their skill level. The best part for me is the speakers voices are fantastic. I tend to fixate on anything weird about a voice, like ticks, odd pauses, or gravelly/ nasal tone. But their voices are smooth, perfect, relaxing. This app has really helped me build a meditation practice daily and sleep at night. This is the first meditation app that also was able to teach me to breath correctly. Thank you!!!","Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Animated breathing exercises, Sleep meditations, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)",Positive
"I've been using this for a couple months on my phone and really liked it, of all the meditation apps I've tried it's the only one I found with sleep meditations long enough to actually help me sleep. Unfortunately, I just bought a new tablet and it doesn't work on it, it crashes immediately after the initial 'B' screen. Tried restarting the tablet, force quitting the app, uninstall and reinstall, but nothing has helped, so as it is the app is unusable on my device (still works fine on my phone).","Sleep Meditations, Cross-Device Compatibility",Positive
"As of now, more limited meditation options compared to Headspace and the like. Still, the way the teachers emphasize certain physical skills to help, like focusing on a breath count or sensations at your pace, is amazing. Other programs I've tried so far focus on what the instructor's rate of breathing is, or vague descriptions of refocusing. The different methods taught in this app has helped me stay focused during the meditation (I have adhd, so that's a big thing for me). So far, so good.","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises, Breath Focus meditation technique",Positive
"I'm only on day 4, so I'm relatively new, but don't take this lightly...this is life changing. I suffer from chronic pain from Fibro, migraines, degenerative disk disease, etc. Things get better and worse, but research is showing Meditation is one of the best ways to treat chronic pain. I've never been able because it's always been ""visualize clouds"", etc. None of that here so far. Straight forward, understandable, and truly helpful. I'm doing several programs and singles easily. Thank you!!","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, guided breathing exercises, animated breathing exercises",Positive
"Downloaded a few months ago and am hooked! I use it every night to sleep. Love the simple app design that's easy to use doesn't overload with info, but allows you to click for deeper reading. I've listened to many meditation podcasts and calm type apps and this speaker's voice and energy is one of the most calming I've heard. I also love that the app will play simultaneously with Spotify, so I can play waterfall sounds or light music behind it if I choose. Seriously give it a try!","Simple app design, Guided meditations, Simultaneous playback with other apps (e.g. Spotify), Sleep stories/sounds",Positive
I really like the daily program Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â It's increasing my confidence in my own ability to meditate consistently. The narrator's is great Ã¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸Â I feel like all the sessions are personal and feel live. He doesn't instruct in a pre-recorded manner so that it feels like you are being left behind. He speaks like he has all day. I've never had an instructor have such realistic pace before. I also like that there's no background ambient music to start. I think it helps me take the sessions more seriously.,"Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Guided sessions without background ambient music, Narrator's pace and tone",Positive
"I'm about a week in and this is very well done. I'm still on the free trial (which is a year, I love it. I wish more apps did something similar.) but I'm leaning towards a lifetime license closer to my trial ending. The personalization is great, the male voice is amazing, so relaxing and wonderful. I've tried meditation before but this app allows even a short 3 minute meditation to feel powerful, meaningful, and relaxing. Even with a toddler and a full time job, I know I can find that time.","Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Bite-sized Singles, Animated breathing exercises, 10-day Plans, Male voice audio library, Free trial/Lifetime license",Positive
"Too repetitive... I just got started, wanted to use this app for my mood mostly but also tried procrastination. Felt like I did the same course 2 times. You want better mood? Take a deep breath... and out... you want to stop procrastination? Dake a deep breath... and out... There is nothing much to it, I chose 5 minutes per meditation and half of it is pure silence, other half is extremely repetitive. Hope it changes anytime soon, otherwise I feel like I already knew all this without this app.","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Guided breathing exercises",Positive
"Was ridiculous as a free app and was far far more than worth it when I paid for a lifetime membership. Had a headache last night that would not go away. Did the pain meditation... Gone. Couldn't get to sleep the other night. Did the sleep meditation? Ã°ÂÂÂ´ If something stresses me out the first thing I think is 'Gonna have to do balance tonight'. When I go to therapy and we get into some really heavy stuff, I use balance in the lyft on the way home and by the time I'm home I'm clear! It's awesome!","Pain meditation, Sleep meditation, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations)",Positive
"I'll be coming back to update this review actively. I started using Balance as of 06.01.22. I work at a fast pace environment so stress is always built up and I've had nowhere really to exhaust that pent up stress. Since I've started, after each session, I feel more relaxed and I get this interesting sensation after opening my eyes, like I'm at peace. I really like using this app any moment I can and I'm planning on keeping it.","Personalized guided meditations, Guided breathing exercises, Singles (stand-alone guided meditations), 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises",Positive
"Decent but restricting. I'd like to journal my emotions and mental well-being but the app is very limiting. Currently I'm feeling distressed and a little overwhelmed by life's choices. The options to journal my emotions are good, average, and not great. When I hit average I get tense, disconnected, neutral, tired, and unfocused. I understand development is trying to be inclusive, but maybe hire developers that have lived a day amongst other humans? I have emotions, try and make room for them.","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Research-backed activities

"Was lucky to participate in a very long trial when the app first came out, used it to end and start my day. Also useful as a resource to study or do office work. Recently I found myself overwhelmed and came back to the app, bought the lifetime membership and haven't regretted it one bit! it's also fun to do the ""together"" singles like the couples ones. Honestly, I can't recommend it enough. Since I've quit smoking I've found guided meditation to really help me self-regulate.","Personalized guided meditations, Singles, Guided breathing exercises, Sleep meditations, 10-day Plans, Animated breathing exercises",Positive
"no 30 second option for breathing, only 1 minute sessions the shortest. doesn't add new plans for very long time, only singles. but very reasonable pricing, UI is very pleasant to use and voices are very calming. could add more different types of voices for variety. there is only two voices. their newsletter doesn't seem to be very helpful in my opinion. i think their communication plan had the most impact for me. it helped me a lot in learning how to communicate and make many friends.","

"I can't say enough good things about this app and how life-changing it is. At first, I thought meditation was hokey and that it wouldn't really work to help me better my life, but, boy, was I wrong. This app has helped me maintain and protect my peace, keeps me centered and grounded, and my life has such a sense of peace and wellness. It has also helped me sleep better.

"Loving my Balance app... Balance is new to me I've recently started using Balance and with just a few times using it I can see progress starting to happen within me. After a session my breathing is calm my mind is more at ease and I'm able to focus more on everything a little clearer.

"This is the absolute best app of all time. It's changed my life. I didn't know there were so many variations to meditation. This app keeps count of your progress, does entire lesson plans, integrates small quizzes to identify where your at and how best to teach you, has options between voices, options for shorter and longer sessions, sections from sleep to ADHD to everything in between. I could keep going on, but I'm only allowed 500 words. More than worth it. Best app I ever downloaded. Ã°ÂÂÂ","

"This is a game changer, I've challenged myself to stay consistent with Balance and its helped me not only repair my relationship with sleep but also has helped me mitigate pain and stress which is huge for someone like myself with psoriatic arthritis. after years of chronic sleep deprivation this works even better than my sleep aid supplement!

"I stumbled upon the Balance app while searching for a meditation app for myself and my clients. What truly caught my attentionÃ¢ÂÂand ultimately my heartÃ¢ÂÂwas the presence of meditations led by a Black man. Representation matters, and hearing his soothing, calming voice moved me to tears during my first session. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a rare and deeply needed touch in a wellness space that often overlooks diversity. Balance is becoming a core part of my daily routine. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just about perfect, and I am so grateful.","Personalized guided meditations, Diversity of meditation leaders (presence of meditations led by a Black man)",Positive
"My favourite app ever, honestly. Love the UI/UX, the app is simple, beautiful, and easy to use. My favourite tab is all sorts of sleep sounds- meditations, stories, background noise, you name it. Very very helpful. One thing I'd absolutely love is some sort of queuing option, like in ""up at night"" there's meditation that slowly transitions into ""sunset melody"" loop track and can be set for 8-10 hours. I'd sooo love to be able to queue loop background noise/sounds after other meditations too!","Sleep Sounds, Meditations, Background Noise, Queuing Option for Loop Tracks",Positive
"I love this app. I recommend it to everyone. It is so easy and not demanding like others. No rushing to get done. Found I was waiting for the next step and insteaf wr were finished. It's great. Make sure to listen to each instructor as the sound of the voice is important. Then, choose your preferred voice. The sleep section is phenomenal and so helpful. Thank you for such a great product.

Pretty good app app far but I wish you could change your daily streak reset time. I like to meditate before bed but sometimes that's before midnight and sometimes it's after. Having to work about midnight to manage my streak gets annoying. It would be nice to be able to set the rest time to 3am (for example) so I don't have to worry about my streak being lost just because I meditate at 12.30am one night. I also would like to be able to edit past meditations especially where I made a mistake,"Daily Streak, Meditation Scheduling, Edit Past Meditations",Positive
"As someone that suffers with OCD, GAD, Panic, etc (I'm autistic), this has been one of the best apps I have ever found. I always poo pood meditation because I had never found a good app. This app has changed my perspective on everything about meditation. His voice is so calming and reassuring I love it. I noticed a big difference in my anxiety levels as soon as I started using this app and continue to use it.

My brain kind of reset and it took almost three months to get back to some kind of normal for me. My daughter sent me a link to this app with the one year of free use, and it was a lifesaver for handling anxiety.

"Love this app. Feedback: -the badge achievements are way too far reaching. It very quickly goes from achievable to wildly unrealistic which loses all interest in winning them. 1 month streak jumps to 1 year streak, thats physically impossible.

"I'm still not convinced, as a more experienced meditator, most of the skills they present are know to me, and revisiting them feels tedious and a chore. Furthermore, ""downloading"" a new session or narrator takes for ever, most times just freezes unable to chance the male or female voice, and gets stuck at ""downloading 0%"". Those are my main issues atm. I like how it takes in consideration what ever you input on creating the session. I have more positive things, but running out of characters.","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles, Animated breathing exercises, Downloading sessions/narrators feature",Positive
"I absolutely love this app! I downloaded it because it's the same company that came out with Elevate, and they offered a 1 year trial. Despite already buying a year's worth of use from a competitor's app, I use Balance instead. I'm up to day five of Foundations V and I can feel the improvement in my mood and concentration. I think what makes it so great is having a plan to follow, and the fact I'll lose my streak if I miss a day. It keeps me practicing daily. Also, Ofosu is just so calming!","Personalized program, 10-day Plans, Guided sessions, Streak feature, Foundations Plan",Positive
"The option to use the app free for a year is fantastic; it helps to create a solid routine and once my free year is up I'm absolutely certain I'll buy the full version. I love Leah's calming voice and have noticed changes in my stress levels from the first week. I also find the graphics simple and the layout uncluttered and easy to navigate. I highly recommend this app to anyone starting to meditate, and reading some books alongside is helpful too. I find 'The Diamond Mind' helpful.","Personalized guided meditations, Free trial, Guided breathing exercises, Simple graphics and layout, Calming voice of the guide (Leah)",Positive
"I so badly wanted to like this app, I find the one year free to be a very good offer. The plans are the best part of the app, but selection is quite limited. Same with sleep audios, there's not a lot to choose from, and personally I didn't find ones that were for me. Also not being able to combine a sleep sound (like rain or quiet music) to meditation? For a free app, sure, it's ok, but I would never pay the full price for the app as it is currently.","Plans, Sleep Audios, Combination of Sleep Sounds and Meditation",Positive
"Loving this! Simple menus, easy to navigate. Both Leah and Ofosu have beautiful, soothing voices. I usually strictly prefer femine voices, but Ofosu is on another level! Great options for sleep as well as guides for meditation depending on skill level. I like that I didn't have to slog through beginner courses to progress to advanced.

"Fantastic. There is a slight jarring feeling when you can tell it plays an audio cue based on feedback you gave in the previous meditation. It doesn't detract from the experience, rather it feels like a good idea executed 95% well and I'm happy to have it. Ex: ""It's good that your mind wasn't wandering"".

"I had a lot of problems when trying to sleep. This app helped me so much. It actually got me to stop thinking and focus onto whatever the person was saying, which eventually lead me to a deep sleep. I would definitely recommend this to people who are overthinkers and have difficulty in clearing their mind. Even tho I had the 1 year trial, I didnt need it because within a month of using it, I could go to sleep by following the exercises it tells you to do.

"This app is wonderful. I got their free year round subscription during covid (i don't know if they're still offering it) and there's a genuine chance I'll renew it next year. They have meditations to fit almost every moment, and make me want to come back. The way they tailor meditations to you based on what you need, your skill level, how long it's been since you meditated, etc. really is the cherry on top.

"Would really appreciate more time options! More 3 minute meditations would be helpful. I'm new to mediation, which I've told the app and am trying to build a more consistent habitat. When doing singles for more restless moods I struggle with friction to sit down for a 10 minutes mediation.

I enjoyed my first month using balance. However after one month using various plans the meditations have gotten longer and longer. I wanted to start foundations 4 but what is supoy to be 10 minutes turned in 16. My time is limited but I'm trying to squeeze 10 minutes in throughout my day.

I was very skeptical as to whether I would click with it as I've struggled to sleep my whole life (I'm 35 with adhd and ""nothing else had worked"") I can now fall asleep in under 10 mins.

I had been struggling severely to fall asleep at night, my concentration levels were all over the place and I felt just generally overwhelmed and lost....

"It's good and I have found it useful. I completed the foundations 1 course, but foundations 2 seems to be the same. Every meditation follows the same format: Settle into posture, focus on breathing, telling you to label and then let go. I feel like I'm stuck doing the same meditation again and again. Yes, I'm using my labels, I've settled into my posture, I can feel the support. But every meditation tells me to do it, even though I am already. It gets repetitive and frustrating, so I stop.","Foundations Plan, Guided Meditations, 10-day Plans, Personalized guided meditations",Positive
"I've never been able to stick with meditation in the past, having tried several times using many different apps. The content, structure and overall tone of Balance is amazing, I love how it is customised to my goals. The plans help build on skills, and it adapts to how well you feel you've internalised them. The male coach, Ofosu, has such a warm and engaging presence. I've been using this app for two weeks and I can already feel the benefit in my day to day life.

"I have used Headspace, Calm and now Balance. This feels more like the early days of Headspace where things were open and you could explore the app. I enjoy the sessions although neither of the two voices works for me. There is also a whole range of gamification around your abilities and streak length, etc. Which are intriguing but if you happen to start a session on one day and it goes onto the next, you lose. One novel feature is the personalisation - but I am not convinced it really works.","Personalisation, Guided Sessions, Gamification, Streak length, Meditation Sessions",Positive
"I hardly, if ever, rave about an app. I am not joking when I say this app saved my life.

"I don't normally review apps but I feel compelled to review Balance. I have used it each day for the past 44 days. Why I love this app is due to its personalised approach, which I feel apps like headspace do not provide and end up feeling quite repetitive and generic.

Could not recommend enough, been telling all my friends.","Personalized guided meditations, 10-day Plans, Singles",Positive

It might benefit from a 'sometimes' option. 2)At the beginning, it asks you to pick and rank in order of importance what you want to get from meditation; I chose: improve focus, improve mood.

still unsure about it but I do like it more then other meditation apps and like that you get a too use this one free for a year if unable to pay because they don't believe that financial issues should stop someone from getting the help they need. that's one thing I will say that peeked my interest because with other apps you have to pay so much money for services or to unlock single sessions or even just for basic things but this one gives you a choice for your first year which I found amazing!,"Free Trial for a Year, Personalized Program, Affordable Pricing",Positive

"I have tried and tried again to find a way to get back on track after a very long, MDD episode (clinical Major Depressive Disorder)... And I found this app, this amazing app! I paid for the premium after the first month of usage; yes, I feel that it is worth it for all that it does actually do. However, I still feel it is just a little bit more expensive then I would like. But again, for all that it does and what you can learn, what you can enact within your daily life, and all that you can do throughout the programs and courses... I pretty much will keep paying the monthly charge until I can truly invest in myself fully! Sadly, I stopped taking proper care of myself for that one month I had already paid for, but I can honestly say, that it's on me and that I wasn't very active, let alone BE proactive, during my really tough times. The point of this long-winded journey is, is that this app is totally worth it for free and the premium version definitely has a lot more programs to help you better yourself. I wouldn't pay for the premium until you were sure you were ready to ""be about it, not talk about it..."" In other words, unless you are absolutely sure that you are truly ready for your own, mostly customizable, journey inwards with yourself and ready to take your life back, hold off paying for the premium version. Because, if you're not ready to do the work, then that monthly, yearly, lifetime subscription will not be worth a single penny. But, please do actually give this a 100% true try and see results in yourself (and even those around you) that perhaps you haven't seen in quite some time. Aannnddd, one more thing.... Absolutely do enjoy yourself while changing, altering, and taking back control of your own life, once and for all! Hint: For this app to truly work for you, you must truly put in a lot of hard work for yourself...

(basically gamifying the important things I want to accomplish) and the web app is really good for a top down view of where you're at.","Goal Setting, Gamification, Web App, Progress Tracking",Positive
"After using this app for just over a month, I decided to buy the premium version yesterday! I had tried many different apps like this in the past but this is the only one that had the wheel of life structure I have been following on a notebook. This app makes it so easy and convenient plan my day on the go and has such great resources and courses. If there's anything I'd like you to change, it's being able to add tasks under each section in Access Life related to each focus.","Wheel of Life structure, Task management, Courses, Access Life feature, Goal planning, Mobile accessibility",Positive
"The web version can get much better, but the mobile app is quite good. A bit more of goal categories and routine management similar to that Fabulous app. That should move it up to 5 stars for me. Update: I've since moved from Success Wizard to using Remente and I honestly think there's nothing better out there. A Google calendar intergration for tasks would be highly appreciated.","Goal categories, Routine management, Google calendar integration for tasks",Positive
I really loved the app. It's organized and I can track all my goals in one place with all the steps and details. The courses are also helpful. The only thing I didn't like about it is that I need to pay for some courses and also to see what I have been doing so far. I understand that some courses are not free but I want to be able to see what I did yesterday and what I'm going to do tomorrow or the day after. The app doesn't let me see or organize past/future daily plans. I just wish that maybe you can make that free. It would be great that way.,"Goal Setting, Course Management, Daily Planning, Progress Tracking",Positive
"The most important part of journalling for me is the opportinity to reflect. Micro-journalling with Remente is a low-friction way to get a lot of the value from journalling, in a lot less time. I've been able to make some positive changes using the analytics tools Remente provides during the COVID-19 lockdown. These sorts of apps make the world better. Fantastic work to everyone who works on this. You're all doing a great, great job. I hope you all continue to succeed :)","Micro-journalling, Analytics tools, Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness",Positive
"I like the concept for this app but sadly, the widget doesn't function like how I wanted to. It would be great if we can complete the goal by clicking the widget. I also cant seem to open the app by clicking the widget. The widget is useless so far... i'd really love it if you'd fix it! But overall, great app!","Widget functionality, Goal achievement, App launch from widget",Positive
"I'd like to be able to split tasks into sub tasks, not just goals. Maybe even a percentage indicator to see a. how well I completed tasks on a daily basis and b. the extent to which I complete the master task. Really good app nevertheless, I appreciate no ads in the free version and the level of functionality you receive before you hit a paywall is perfectly acceptable. You dont feel like you have a half-baked app like many other self improvement apps on the free/trial version.","Task Management, Sub-task Management, Progress Tracking, Goal Achievement, Ad-free Experience",Positive
"It's a wonderful app for personal goals management. Not giving 5 Ã°ÂÂÂ due to following reasons: - Not able to add tasks with the recurring interval of more than a week. For example, I need to set some review monthly. - Cannot add labels to the tasks though which I can filter. I want to add lifestyles as labels. For example I can have tasks regarding fitness in multiple goals, would want to know, what all am I doing for fitness and where I'm. - There's no way to add sub tasks.","Task Management, Goal Setting, Filtering, Subtasks, Recurring Tasks",Positive
"I like it cause I want to feel productive but I can't really do much since my classes hasn't started. So I like having little tasks throughout the day. I like the ""how do you feel today"" feature. I just wished they added more courses for free. The goal feature is good. Oh yeah, they give you courses to read/listen to (How to eat less sugar, how to stop worrying, etc.)","Task management, Mood tracking (""how do you feel today"" feature), Course library, Goal setting",Positive
"It has helped me a lot ( based on my past 4 months of usage) . I always have my day plan in front of me which helps me know when I'm wasting my time based on how much I've covered in the day. Mood tracker helps me maintain a mood-log that helps me analyse how I've been throughout the day emotionally. Having these things in front of your eyes is really essential, so that you can actively make your day better. UI is easy and intuitive to use which is a bonus. Keep it up Ã°ÂÂÂ","Day Planner, Mood Tracker, UI",Positive
"I WAS really enjoying the app, but then today, some of the tasks I had set to appear on sundays using the goals feature didn't show up... the whole point of me going through all the effort to assign certain tasks to certain days was so that I wouldn't have to remember what needed to be done each day; I'd just be able to do it. But now I'm going to be paranoid and have to double check that nothing is missing each day. I use the app for my work so it's very important that nothing gets missed","Goal Achievement, Time Management, Goal Setting",Positive
"It takes more than just a list of to-dos to really see your life get better in every area. This app is so essential to me, so helpful in not only laying out a plan, but also in finding the reason for the plan and help with the how. If you like yoga, you'll like this. And if you like the idea of living a balanced life, remembering to love people in the midst of other goals, you'll like this.","Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Time Management, Balanced Life Management",Positive
This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something. I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.,"Course Catalog, Support Team, Mental Health Courses (specifically for depression, anxiety, and eating disorders)",Positive
"The app has good content but could improve the ff: 1. Custom goals could also be categorized per life area and linked back to life assessment. 2. Tasks, habits, and milestones help achieve goals. I hope we can categorize these ""steps"" and have nuanced tracking functions and analytics. 3. The app functions as a good journal. Please make it easier to review entries by adding hashtags or categories. 4. Add photo database. 5. Add auto back-up function.","Goal Setting, Life Assessment

"I love this app!!!! I get to plan my day out,and at night it gives me reminders to tell the app how my day was. you get about five choices on how you feel. Based sad to happy. Then you also get to pick more choices on how you feel. Like you could say your stressed,tired,lonely on the negative side or happy,positive,calm etc. on the positive side. It gives you courses to go though to help get your life together. you can write Down your feelings like a diary.And you can set goals.I recommend it!","Day Planning, Mood Tracking, Emotional State Tracking, Courses, Diary, Goal Setting",Positive
"These past weeks I've been reviewing top-rated apps that can help against procrastination and none is perfect so I'm designing mine. Remente is definitely the one inspiring me the most, especially the rate-your-mood-and-explain-why feature. Other apps better handle to-do lists (Todoist), commitment to goals (stickK) or timing/pomodoro stuff (Productivity Challenge Timer, Forest). But what really keeps me coming back to Remente is that I'm led to input personal thoughts and that feels engaging !","

I love the visual representation and various resources that help with being balanced in every spectrum of life. It helps me put things into perspective and utilize techniques that they teach in therapy and books about anexity. 10/10 would recomend !,"Visual Representation, Goal Achievement, Stress Management, Self-Awareness",Positive
"It is definitely so much more than I thought it could be. It is very unobtrusive while still being encouraging. It is pretty easy to use and I like that there are keywords for mood logging so that you are helped along in being more specific on your mood states--I found this to be very mindful and caused me to put more thought into my feelings and the reasons behind them, as well as take time to appreciate them. Pricing is fair. May be worth upgrading even though money is tight.","Mood Logging, Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Mindfulness Tools",Positive
"2 years later and I'm writing a new review. The premium gets in the way, of course, and knowing you have to pay your way to good mental health is kinda wack, BUT, it is what it is, and I think the free version is wonderful. Really helping me - I even told my therapist about it. Would recommend :)","Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Stress Management",Positive
"when i first started using the app i had trouble. once i used the resources my emotion changed on it. yo this is a good app. even the free version has helped me out. id suggest using the insight chart before you start journaling and creating goals. always work om your weak areas. you will never delete this app. using the insight will help you figure out why you may be feeling sad, lonely or depressed. It will show you if you really want friends and a social life. maybe you want to be loved.","Insight Chart, Journaling, Goal Creation, Stress Management, Self-Awareness, Emotional Management",Positive
"It gave me step by step guides and suggestions on how I could work on things to better my daily life! It broke everything down so it made it simple, easy to achieve and understand!

Cheers to whoever made this!","Goal Achievement, Self-Awareness, Time Management, Decision Making",Positive
"My life is in chaos! I know a lot of it is making bad choices. So I decided to try this app. It was a bit complicated, but once I began to understand it, the key is being able to view your past, so you could see how far you've come. That's when they spring on you the fees you have to pay for that info. In other words, they take the appearance that they care about you and the details of your life, which is a lie, they want your money!
