"I love this app and what they do. But boy do I not like the update. I have a lot of problems with it. It's laggy, it hangs, sometimes won't load at all, randomly signs me out. I don't find it helpful that the first page doesn't just load up to meditations, but loads up to the accreditation message and you can't get rid of it.I also don't think the purple everything, or the organization of meditations are as clear or easy on the eyes as the old app was.

"It was really nice, i used it for a week,and I really liked the organization of it all and it helped me with my adhd. Then,out of the blue it. Changed into some ""mental fitness"" thing.

"I've been using this app for years and it's always been my favorite meditation app. I had done almost all of the meditations and saved many of them as my favorites. I think the new update looks really good, however my problem with it (other than having lost all of my favorite meditations ‚òπÔ∏è) is that when I do a meditation, it is not marked as 'done'. Also some of the background music tracks do not work. I hope these bugs get fixed and thank you for genuinely caring about our mental health ‚ù§Ô∏è",ive using app year always favorite meditation app done almost meditation saved many favorite think new update look really good however problem lost favorite meditation meditation marked done also background music track work hope bug get fixed thank genuinely caring mental health,1
I just downloaded the new update and I cannot believe what has happened to the app. Smiling minds has basically saved my life and now it's a garish garbled mess of random unorganized meditations and awful color and font choices. I can't make heads and tails out of it. Plus months of progress and curating are gone! Frankly the new layout is such a mess that it caused me anxiety. I really don't understand what happened but if the app doesn't revert I am removing it from my phone.,downloaded new update cannot believe happened app smiling mind basically saved life garish garbled mess random unorganized meditation awful color font choice cant make head tail plus month progress curating gone frankly new layout mess caused anxiety really dont understand happened app doesnt revert removing phone,1

"It has a major bug that stops it from working. Each exercise you complete has to be registered by the app as complete before you can do the next. Unfortunately the app generally doesn't recognize that you have completed the exercise, so you have to play it repeatedly (usually 3 times) before the app allows you to .I've to the next exercise.

"This app is so frustrating!!! It constantly glitches, won't load or stops half way through. My kids love it and we've used it every night for years. Incredibly frustrating when it suddenly wont work. When I provided feedback, all they could do was ask for a screen recording. How is that helpful or even possible when the app won't even open!!!

"The version before the recent update was fantastic. The content is great however, the newer version is unreliable for tracking, consistency, even usability. I often open the app and it simply refuses to load anything. The notifications do not work. Meditations will stop midway. The titles on everything has changed, and for new users, I believe if I hadn't been using this for years before the update, some content will be locked to you.

"Great app was having problems with it crashing during audio playback but realised it was being caused by me locking my phone to reduce the brightness in an otherwise dark room.

I really loved the old version of the app. I don't think there was a need to change things so dramatically. When I went to log back in a couldn't find my favourites they had been wiped.

"Such a frustrating app since they changed to the new version.. it constantly won't load, even after restarting the app, clearing the cache etc. There are less choices of meditations than what they had too.

"The new app is very frustrating. I just want to find meditation recordings and they're buried under menus for various ""courses"". Now I need to meditate and I have to spend 15 minutes trying to find a useful session.

"Generally great app overall. Only reason for not five stars is the latest update is glitchy. Favourites suddenly disappeared, along with the option to add to favourites.

"Personally, I don't think audiences get as excited about rebrands or new looks to apps as the developers are but that might be just me.

"I totally disagree with the meditation track saying ""no pets in the bedroom"" as they disrupt sleep. SOMETIMES this is true, but having my cat on my pillow was the only thing that helped me sleep soundly when I was severely depressed.
