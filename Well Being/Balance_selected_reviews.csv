"day two and I'm already feeling the change in my stress level. free trial gave me access to everything so I haven't looked around and seen all that available, but so far, I'm VERY impressed by this app!! I'm already feeling less anxious and if I ever hit a panic attack, they have an SOS meditation guide for on the spot needs. I love this one so much, can't wait to see what all I can get accomplished as I strive towards a more stress free life! thank you devs so much for opening up the trial!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§",day two im already feeling change stress level free trial gave access everything havent looked around seen available far im impressed app im already feeling less anxious ever hit panic attack so meditation guide spot need love one much cant wait see get accomplished strive towards stress free life thank devs much opening trial,1
"I did the Balance one year free trial a few years ago but didn't manage to build a consistent habit and ended up trying a few apps that were either totally free or had a good number of free meditations. I ended up coming back to Balance and buying a lifetime membership and am meditating daily now. I like that each meditation adapts and that some gives options (like the Pomodoro session). I also like that everything is rooted in science and explanations are given, no esoterism to be found.",balance one year free trial year ago didnt manage build consistent habit ended trying apps either totally free good number free meditation ended coming back balance buying lifetime membership meditating daily like meditation adapts give option like pomodoro session also like everything rooted science explanation given esoterism found,1
"Really great app. Love all the quiet options to relax for bed or have soothing white noise type things playing. Would be 5 stars if there were cast support. My kids love the sleep meditations, and I can use the media output settings built into my phone to play things on the Google speakers in their rooms, but it's clunky and disconnects all the time. Cast support would be great to set it and forget it so it's playing on its own and not relying on my phone.

"It would be good, if there was an option, to restart the meditation plans at any points, if I feel got lost with them, or repeat anytime in a later point in the future. Also there is a bug, if a fullscreen notification comes up, like a calendar reminder, will makes the meditation stop, and when recognising that it was stopped, and get the notification out of the way, the meditation would just start from the beginning, instead continue from the point it was disrupted..

"I was diagnosed with dysautonomia (from covid) and have troubles with anxiety, tachycardia, blood pressure spikes, pvcs, fatigue, seeing/feeling/hearing my pulse, chest pain, pressure in chest, vertigo, vision blacking out, etc. I stumbled upon this app, and it has really helped me to reduce stress levels, raise my HRV, get a better night's sleep, gain more energy, and am able to switch back into parasympathetic much faster now.

I'm on Day 2 of the free 1-year trial. I love the guided meditation practices and the numerous categories that you can choose from. There's also an unguided option in case you don't or can't follow along with a guided session. It can be distracting for some people to hear someone throughout a 5- or 10-minute session. I've been going through a severe depressive episode and bouts of general anxiety. These last two sessions helped me to focus and mentally regroup. I can't wait to practice more.,im day 2 free 1year trial love guided meditation practice numerous category choose there also unguided option case dont cant follow along guided session distracting people hear someone throughout 5 10minute session ive going severe depressive episode bout general anxiety last two session helped focus mentally regroup cant wait practice,1

"I saw this was offered at a full year for free & I was immediately interested. Most apps give you, at most, 2 weeks free. I felt they must have faith in their product to offer that kind of promo. I've used it daily, 1-3 times per day, for 3 weeks. It is hands down the best meditation app I've ever used. I look forward to meditating instead of feeling like it's a chore or task to complete.

"This is by far the BEST meditation app out there. I love all the singles, I love that in the ""breaking habits"" one if you select smoking they don't specifically say cigarettes in the meditation (I'm trying to quit weed). Ofosu has a very soothing voice and I love all the educational aspects. I got a whole year free trial and I try to use it every day.

"I love this app!!! Due to undiagnosed ADHD, I stopped meditating due to my increasing inability to sit, focus, and enjoy the moment. I typically never gravitated towards guided meditation because the repetition was even worse.

The nightly meditations and the daily skills I'm learning to meditate even better. I feel more relaxed when ever I finish one. At night it never fails to put me to sleep. I like that the lessons are short because I don't always have a lot of time on my hands. The fact that I get to try it free for a year too is great. It gives me a chance to really decide whether it's something that will work to help lower my stress and help me to gain better focus throughout the day.

"Lovely, generous. Adaptive to whatever your needs are. Personalized to each individual and their skill level. The best part for me is the speakers voices are fantastic. I tend to fixate on anything weird about a voice, like ticks, odd pauses, or gravelly/ nasal tone. But their voices are smooth, perfect, relaxing.

"I've been using this for a couple months on my phone and really liked it, of all the meditation apps I've tried it's the only one I found with sleep meditations long enough to actually help me sleep. Unfortunately, I just bought a new tablet and it doesn't work on it, it crashes immediately after the initial 'B' screen.

"As of now, more limited meditation options compared to Headspace and the like. Still, the way the teachers emphasize certain physical skills to help, like focusing on a breath count or sensations at your pace, is amazing. Other programs I've tried so far focus on what the instructor's rate of breathing is, or vague descriptions of refocusing. The different methods taught in this app has helped me stay focused during the meditation (I have adhd, so that's a big thing for me).

I suffer from chronic pain from Fibro, migraines, degenerative disk disease, etc. Things get better and worse, but research is showing Meditation is one of the best ways to treat chronic pain.

"Downloaded a few months ago and am hooked! I use it every night to sleep. Love the simple app design that's easy to use doesn't overload with info, but allows you to click for deeper reading. I've listened to many meditation podcasts and calm type apps and this speaker's voice and energy is one of the most calming I've heard.

I really like the daily program ‚ù§Ô∏è It's increasing my confidence in my own ability to meditate consistently. The narrator's is great ‚ò∫Ô∏è I feel like all the sessions are personal and feel live. He doesn't instruct in a pre-recorded manner so that it feels like you are being left behind.

"I'm about a week in and this is very well done. I'm still on the free trial (which is a year, I love it. I wish more apps did something similar.) but I'm leaning towards a lifetime license closer to my trial ending. The personalization is great, the male voice is amazing, so relaxing and wonderful.

Pretty good app app far but I wish you could change your daily streak reset time. I like to meditate before bed but sometimes that's before midnight and sometimes it's after.

"I like how Balance gives a free trial year in pure altruism for your mental wellbeing, especially notting that hussling money out of peeps is not a motivation.

To be consistent with the stated motivation it could be offered at the end of the trial. If peeps like the app they would heavely consider. Aside from that looks good.

"I've tried a LOT of different mediation apps, some were good, some ok, but this one is the one that got to me. Maybe it's all apps I've tried before that helped me to understand what this one is teaching, but in any way I'm staying with this one for a while. Every time I hear Ofosu I know in the next few minutes I'll be much better. It is such a meaningful experience. Thank you guys for the amazing work you do.",ive tried lot different mediation apps good ok one one got maybe apps ive tried helped understand one teaching way im staying one every time hear ofosu know next minute ill much better meaningful experience thank guy amazing work,0

The exercises with kids are great too.",really effective surprised well helped started clenching jaw like mad last fall almost completely stopped even dont stick learn lifelong skill stay aware body exercise kid great,0
