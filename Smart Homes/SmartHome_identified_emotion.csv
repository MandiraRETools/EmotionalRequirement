- **Independence**: High, as they are capable of managing and approving changes without needing external assistance.

However, if the AI suggestions are too frequent, poorly explained, or not aligned with their expertise, they might feel:

- **Sense of Obstruction**: Moderate, if the process of reviewing and approving becomes overly cumbersome or if the suggestions are not reliable, hindering their workflow.

### Demographic 2: Novice Individuals from Non-Technical Background

Novice individuals without a technical background might be less familiar with automation and AI-driven suggestions. They may need clearer explanations of the suggested changes and a simpler approval process.

- **Sense of Control**: Moderate, as they may feel less in control if they do not fully understand the suggestions or fear making a wrong decision.
- **Sense of Confusion**: High, if the system does not provide clear, user-friendly explanations of the suggested automations and their implications.
- **Sense of Being Cared**: Potentially high, if the system is designed in an intuitive way that makes them feel supported and guided through the approval process.
- **Insecurity**: Moderate to high, as they might worry about approving a suggestion that could have unintended consequences, due to their lack of technical knowledge.

However, if the system is well-designed with clear explanations and intuitive interfaces, their:

- **Satisfaction**: Could be high, knowing they have the final approval and that the system is designed to support them.
- **Independence**: Could increase over time as they become more comfortable with the system and its suggestions.

### Accessing Provided Contexts for Relevant Examples

Reviewing past user feedback and reviews from similar features in healthcare application systems, we find examples such as the need for customization, automation capabilities, and clear, simple interfaces. Users have expressed a desire for control over their system, the ability to understand and approve changes, and the importance of the system being user-friendly.

- A review stating, ""Steep learning curve. But the possibilities are endless!"" suggests a sense of **Satisfaction** and **Independence** for those willing to invest time in understanding the system.
- A feature request for a ""proper universal app"" indicates a need for **Sense of Control** and simplicity in managing different aspects of their healthcare or automation needs.

In conclusion, the emotional responses to the functional requirement of reviewing and approving AI-suggested automation before application can vary significantly based on the user's technical background. Clear, intuitive design and comprehensive explanations of automation suggestions are key to balancing the need for control with the benefits of efficiency and optimization offered by AI-driven automation."
