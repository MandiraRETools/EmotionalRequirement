"Need to add the ability to say ""snooze"" for alarms on the Google Nest Hubs. Also, the Home app would be GREATLY improved if it placed a box around faces that the camera sees. I constantly get alerts for a familiar face in my garage, even though there is absolutely no person or animal in the garage. So I have no idea what the camera thinks is a person. Lastly, the Home app tends to freeze for 5 to 20 seconds when viewing the live camera feed on wifi or broadband connections with full signal.","Review -> Alarm Management, Face Detection, Live Camera Feed, App Performance"
"Overall it works, but there are some very poor design choices. For example, creating an automation for my govee lights only allows me to pick a set of pre-chosen light colors that map extremely poorly to the actual lights' colors, and there's no way to test what they look like without saving the automation, exiting, and playing it. But choosing a color for the lights outside of the automation screen offers a full color wheel that maps much more closely to the actual light colors.","Review -> Color Selection, Automation Testing, User Interface"
"Be great if my app would connect to my nest speakers. Getting sick of losing use of my Google speakers once every update, claims I'm not on the same wifi as them, or that I need to restart my wifi. Guess what Google I have reset my wifi FIVE TIMES this weekend trying to get my speaker working and IT STILL WON'T CONNECT!

"Somehow the integration with Philips Hue bulbs (one of the main reasons that I got Google Home/Nest/Hub devices) has completely gone downhill over the past few years. It used to work seamlessly, then started to disconnect for minutes to hours at a time, and now they've completely stopped working for about two weeks. Many other users have reported the same issue onlineâcan we get a fix Google, and fast? My bulbs still work with the dedicated Hue app, so presumably the issue lies on Google's side.","Review -> Integration with Philips Hue Bulbs, Connectivity, Compatibility with Smart Home Devices"
"Cameras work better than expected. Clear HDR, notifications rarely delayed or wrong. App on the other hand is a complete dumpster fire, buggy, Constant spinning blue circle. Constant disconnects. ""Tell us more (optional)"" ...yep, spinning blue circle. Constant ""This video isn't available for viewing yet, check back later"". Google fixes one thing but creates 10 more bugs.

"It tries to be so many things but little to nothing well. Faulty UI sprinkled throughout. Also, if you have older Nest cams, the Home app is not for you unless you don't want any interactive features. However, if you dont want features, then, yes, you want Home. Feedback: Google should here interns to sift thru all the comments instead of having customers go to a form and do the work for Google. Finally, make the camera viewing have a 15 second skip feature. It's a no-brainer feature.","Review -> User Interface, Compatibility, Camera Viewing Features, Feedback Mechanism"
Setting up a Google nest router is extremely complicated. It's much easier to do on a computer and you have to use the app with these devices. If you had it set up on one phone you get a new phone afterwards. The Google home app doesn't always add the old home information or you have to set up completely and wipe the router in order to set it up on the new phone. It is a huge hassle and not recommended. Avoid Google nest products at all costs. The free device is just too costly to use,"Setting up a Google nest router is extremely complicated -> Ease of Setup, Compatibility

"Devs cant Remove Local Devices?bull. Basic functionality that was around like 7 years ago, like sending a text message through voice has become non-existent. In the event that it actually does cue it up. The functionality that used to have ie: adding to the end of the message, if cut you off. Would you like to send? ""add to it"" is no longer functioning.

The time and weather became ridiculously small! Why would you guys change what was essentially one of the best features of the Chromecast? Not user friendly and extremely ageist and discriminatory.

"Useless app for wifi management. Cannot even do the simplest of tasks. Wish I had not purchased. Edit: stating you are looking for ways to improve is an insincere gesture. Linking to a useless article is a thought-terminating clichÃ©. Basic router settings like renaming 2.4 and 5 GHz with separate SSIDs should not become inaccessible after an update. Update: Is now even more useless. Google Speakers randomly ""unavailable"" even when connected and playing music.","Review -> Wifi Management, Router Settings, Device Connectivity, SSID Management, Update Process, Device Availability"
4 years after my first 1 star review and basic features are still missing that the old Nest app had. Scrubbing through video is painfully slow. No way to simply jump in small increments. Audio only plays through ear speaker instead of main speaker. Continuous recording advertised for some cameras (i.e. battery cameras connected to solar) but doesn't actually work even with valid subscription. Other users constantly get randomly removed from the home and need to get re-added. The list goes on.,"Review -> Video Scrubbing, Audio Playback, Continuous Recording, User Management, Subscription Validation"
"terrible UI. tiny squares that don't even fit the names of the devices. I setup a Google TV and it shows in the app but will not show me a remote or any control capabilities. Google smart products are consistently the worst on the market. I would avoid their TVs and smart devices at all costs. For routines, if you select a Playlist to play it cannot find it. You cannot use smart devices to kickoff a routine, like a temp sensor shows the temp but you cannot create an action. Useless.","Review -> User Interface, Device Control, Routine Setup, Smart Device Integration, Remote Control Capability"
"Time to update the review on how much more useless the entire Google Home automation ecosystem is. No longer able to play personal music playlists, unable to find them half the time and just plays random public playlists, even though it's running a hard coded automated command. No longer can play a playlist shuffled by default. Introduced gimmicky AI responses that just messes with your commands because the probability models of the LLM try to get cute with trying to do basic things.","Review -> Music Playback, Playlist Management, Automated Commands, Voice Command Accuracy, AI Response Quality, Shuffle Functionality"
"Edit 2: it's clear that none of the developers use this app. Utter garbage. You should be ashamed of this ap. Go back to the nest ap. Edit: Nothing they suggested worked. All of the best features in the nest app for the cameras do not exist in the home app. Original: Garbage compared to the nest app and Web interface. Why is there a delay in the video feed. Every time I open the app to watch a camera, the most recent feed is delayed. I should be able to see every second, at any time.","Review -> Video Feed Delay, Feature Parity with Nest App, Real-time Video Feed Capability"
It basically forces you to pay for any storage says you'll have some history like 3 days or whatever... I get 3 mins of history. I can't even. View videos I have notifications for.

"Truly horrible app. Can't find devices on the same network. Online instructions don't match app at all. After an hour of trial and error, got it to control my Google TV via my home mini. After about 15 minutes, that no longer worked. Tried all the trouble shooting tips with no luck. After uninstalling and reinstalling as suggested, it can't see the mini or the TV. 3 hours on a job that should have taken 5 minutes, tops, and no success. Typical Google software. Thrown together, not maintained.","Review -> Device Discovery, App User Interface, Troubleshooting, Compatibility, Connectivity, Control Functionality, Setup Process"
"I overall enjoy this app, but I wish somethings would change: 1.) The ability to delete devices from my Google home wifi mesh. I like to keep the list clean. It shows I have 60 devices, although I only utilize 32 devices. I would like to be able to delete the extra devices. 2.) When someone rings my doorbell, the time it takes for the video to generate on my phone is so slow! I always end up asking who is it-through my door, so I don't lost the visitor, waiting on me to view the live feed.","Review -> Device Management, Live Feed Latency"
"Constantly forgetting speaker groups. I know Google isn't a great company and they don't invest in their products but I regret investing in their home automation ecosystem. Basic use case like grouping speakers is frankly a frustrating nightmare and a total timesink. It just doesn't work consistently for years now. It's not that hard, surely! Constantly forgets speaker groups on devices seemingly at random and then they appear occasionally. It doesn't work and I wish they would address it. Urgh","Review -> Speaker Grouping, Consistency and Reliability"
"This app has been around for years and when it comes to video camera feed editing it's horrible. Wireless cameras are limited to only 3 minutes. The part that is stupid is that once a clip is recorded, you can't delete it. You can't delete any individual clips, you either keep all the video clips untill they expire or delete all of them. Also, when a wireless camera is unmounted from the magnetic mount, all the video history is gone untill it's remounted. If it's stolen it's gone forever","Review -> Video Editing, Clip Management, Data Retention, Camera Mounting, Video History Management, Data Deletion"
"This has gone from spectacular cutting edge tech to straight trash over the years. In the past two years I've tried everything and scoured the Internet hoping someone found a definitive fix for this app. My smart devices fail to function like they used to. If you are lucky and repeat the direction multiple times you might get something to work. I can see the app record my requests perfectly . Resynching, new products, decreasing devices controlled ...

"The main reason I open this app is to connect to my new Google Nest Camera. However its SETTINGS options are quite limited. For example, if the camera is mounted upside down using the bolt facing up into a ceiling bracket, the image is upside down. There is no setting in the app to flip the image upside down. (Other mfrs like ""WYZE"" figured that out and built that feature into their app.) So, to manage these expensive cameras with an unfulfilling app like this, is not easy. UPDATE 10-22-24.

"The app usually works pretty decent but it must not sync up well with devices. I have to ask my Google devices 2-4 times to get a valid response. It has REALLY gone downhill in quality.

"I installed a Google Home device in almost every room in our new home about 3 years ago. for the most part, things seemed to work okay at the time. Over The entire 3 years The system has become almost unusably unintelligent.

"Pretty bad. Basic functionality lacking. For lights, you can't use a color picker but need to select from a few predefined colors, half of which don't work depending on your light (even though the light supports the color, they must be calling it via a stupid name rather than RGB code). Inability to get it to SHUT UP. I tell my Nest to do something, I want it to just do it -- not tell me that it's going to do it. ""Got it, playing blah blah blah""...

Other devices are found via network and Bluetooth all the time without location necessary: headphones, speakers, etc The app seems to insist on precise location to setup now, but I don't recall this limitation before?

"Dropping the five star review I held to a one for now due to the most recent update. It feels like such a step backwards. If there's going to be an update that completely changes a user's experience with the app and alters their familiarity entirely, there should be some sort of option to revert to previous layouts or designs. This update is just not intuitive. Hope there can be change soon, considering all the negative feedback around this version.

The functionality of the app is significantly degraded while using a VPN. Integrating smart home devices is very straight forward. Unless it's a nest device. Which makes zero sense since Google owns it. Obviously keep the parent app for your smart home devices installed because the Home app only provides the basic control over your devices. Routines are helpful to an extent.

"A bit laggy and many products cant use the full functionality that their native apps provide. For example IKEA lightbulbs cant be programmed the same way.

"The low review is for 2 reasons: 1. The incomplete Nest integration is terrible. It's been YEARS and Home still can't manage older Nest cameras! 2. The Home/Away assist is utterly broken. It should be simple. We have 2 phones participating. If EITHER ONE is home, then we are home. But this rarely works. Away mode randomly turns on when one phone is still home. Today, NOTHING changed. Both phones were home and the cameras came on for no reason. But the app was set to HOME, not away. UNTRUSTWORTHY","Review -> Nest Integration, Home/Away Assist Feature"
"Not overly impressed. Bought the Google Battery doorbell to replace a Ring system and its a poor comparison. Battery time is good, camera is good, two way speech works good. Camera doesn't see the ground beneath ii like the ad says. Home app notifications intermittently stop working and have to try multiple things when you realise it's stopped, sound control on playback doesn't work (operates in-call volume instead of media volume).

I spend way too much time in a learning curve...or better, relearning, which is shear stupidity on Google design techs. You haven't made a better mouse trap. You've only made a different version. Now the mouse has to enter the trap backwards.","Review -> Casting Capability, User Interface, Dashboard Organization, Learning Curve/Ease of Use"
