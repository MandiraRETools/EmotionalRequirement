"Trying to get away from cloud-based automation, I installed home assistant on my Synology server, as well as the integration local Tuya. Everything is functioning perfectly. So, I downloaded this app, to control using my phone. The app works well, and it's nicely laid out. However, one star off because widgets are a problem. In essence, when I tap a widget, it does what I want it to do, but then it is replaced by an endlessly spinning arrow. Fix: I have to delete the widget.",Review -> Widget Functionality
"App is great and would have been 5 stars, but the recent update that added Android 11 power menu buttons changed how location is reported. It would always regularly turn on the GPS to get a position, but it was always very brief. Just a flash. Now it keeps GPS on for a minute or longer every time I unlock my phone. It seems to be tied to power menu controls. If I remove all Home Assistant controls it reverts the old behavior. I was using only lights and scenes as power menu tiles.","Review -> Location Reporting, Power Menu Controls, GPS Functionality, Automation"
"Dark theme sucks. The app is great overall, but the app is suck always in dark theme which makes the text on my picture cards white, to contrast with the normally black background, but the picture is white, so you can't see the text at all. Very frustrating. Using my browser to view the same content looks fine. Why can't the phone app look like the web app?","Review -> User Interface, Theme Customization, Display Settings, Compatibility with Web App"
"While the app by itself works fine, the latest update is a bit ""temperamental"". I notice that it looses connection a lot, even when I'm on the same network as my Home Assistant is, and suddenly the Battery and WiFi sensors disappeared. I hope truly that this can be fixed, because I think it is a great addition to Home Assistant. Specifically the fact, that it updates location. Please keep up the good work! And I hope that more sensors will be added.

"Awesome App, but pleeeease assign the ""Location is disabled"" notification to another channel so I can disable that one specifically.

The main server app is great but this phone app is not. Been requesting support for multiple servers/homes for years and am baffled why it is still missing.

"I love home assistant but recently I've been getting an android message that says: ""Home assistant isn't Responding"" about 10 times a day regardless of what I'm doing on my phone.

"The app is great! But i noticed that when you look at a camera stream through the app and you return to the home screen, the stream goes on and it keeps consuming a lot of data.

"App on the phone is flawless and works really well. Saw Android Auto had some love, however in it's current state it is near useless as it just lists everything.

One of the VERY FEW apps out there that supports all native features within the mobile app. It's absolutely amazing being able to add HACS integrations or edit YAML on mobile.,"Review -> Mobile App Features, HACS Integration, YAML Editing"
"Was good but they are moving away from their core audience and breaking integrations that rely on yaml. Wishing I never updated as my entire home network now doesn't work. Could have easily wrapped their front end around yaml but instead decided to exclude their core audience. This platform is supported by it's creators, If you're just starting on HA look elsewhere its stuck a ticking bomb to it's chest.","Review -> YAML Integration, Compatibility, Core Audience Support, Frontend Design, Automation Features, Integration with Smart Devices"

The multi-server connection was the most lacking feature to me! Thx for your efforts and such a great product! It would be great to switch between them somehow in visual way but not only by three-finger swipe.

Love the way its coming along so far. My only complaints deal with speed and widgets. I have a nice dark theme but the widgets just ruin it by being so bright. I would love to see an option to change widgets to look either dark or transparent. I would also like the app to load quicker if possible.,"Review -> Theme Customization, Application Speed, Widget Customization"
Overall it's pretty great. One easy improvement would be to include a hamburger icon so the menu can fly out. Currently there is a back button that does nothing. Can't access the menu nav as a result...,"Review -> Navigation Menu, Menu Accessibility"

"Color wheel sucks, the steps you have to go through to save colors... ugh, I hate it. Give me the old light bulb interface that was more accessible to colorblind people like myself, and ditch the palette.
