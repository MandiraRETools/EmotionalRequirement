"Unwanted Welcome message on TV, taking up 1/5 of my 55"" screen, overlapping my programs on several occasions when I was unable to respond because I could not find my remote, but as soon as I found my remote to click the OK checkbox at the bottom of the message, the welcome message from Smart Things has never reappeared. I haven't used this app on my phone except to connect new devices, but it did work smoothly ten years ago when my TV became unresponsive after I lost my remote for good.","Device Connection, Remote Control, Notification Management, App Responsiveness",Positive
"The latest update ruined the remote control feature. The pause, FF, rewind options are gone, so it's basically useless. Using the app to control the TV was so much better than the almost buttonless tiny remote that came with the TV, but now I'm forced to deal with that little remote. Please go back to the way the remote was in the app. Or at least add back the ability to do more than adjust the volume or change the channel.","Remote Control Feature, User Interface, Volume Control, Channel Control, Pause Function, Fast Forward Function, Rewind Function",Negative
"Garbage app. Installed for a TV purchase. Love the TV hate the bloaty useless pre installed apps and lack of Google compatibility... same with this app. It is about as helpful as soggy toilet paper. More bloat and features you cannot use unless you have a Samsung garbage phone. Cannot use calibration feature which is the only thing I wanted. Pixel 9xl Pro and nope. Useful if you break or lose the garbage TV remote, if you can get through the bloated garbage. Good luck, Samsung is awful.","Compatibility, Calibration Feature, Remote Control, Ease of Use",Negative
"I always come back to leave one star reviews because I think this app is that bad. Never works well. Constantly can't even connect to my tv then I have to unplug my tv. I try using smart things when I can't find my remote to turn my tv on but the app tells me to find the remote to turn the tv on, literally. Completely defeats the purpose of the app and my buying a Samsung tv. That's a mistake I won't be making again. There are even less expensive options that perform way better than Samsung","Connectivity, Remote Control, Compatibility, Ease of Use",Negative
"This app stopped powering on our 75"" Samsung Frame a few updates ago. I can still power on our older 82"" Samsung and control the stove and dishwasher. I've deleted the phone and re-added, even got a new phone, an s24 Ultra, since this started. Everything else works it's just the power button that doesn't. I can hit the home button on our Roku app and that will turn the Frame on. It will turn it off but not on.","Device Control, Compatibility, App Functionality",Negative
"Trying to use this app with my new Frame TV but every time I open the app, it takes several minutes to load and it forces me to re-cancel permissions I've opted out of. When the art category at the bottom finally populates, the art store only recognizes my membership only about half the time (often I'm only offered previews) and when it does recognize my membership, the whole store usually crashes after I view about three images. Complete garbage.","Loading Time, Permission Management, Membership Recognition, App Stability, Image Viewing",Both Positive and Negative
"What an incredibly frustrating user experience. I keep trying to get the TV to use a soundbar but the output setting automatically reverts itself. Also this app opens the Samsung login page every freaking 5 seconds. The TV and the sound bar are connected with an HDMI eARC cable. There's nothing wrong with my setup but this app is extremely unintuitive, and keeps changing things away from the way it's supposed to work which is in theory actually very simple. Guess I won't be buying Samsung again","Ease of Use, Connectivity, Authentication, User Interface, Device Control, Compatibility",Negative
"This remote is every regret that I have about buying a Samsung over a Hisense roku TV. We can't ever keep track of a remote, so it was inevitable we would download this. It constantly wants us to sign into our Samsung account. Then it says that it won't work with my browser. Then I try to open it with another browser and I get stuck in a loop. Sometimes a message will appear on the TV but the remote won't connect to get rid of it. It won't even download onto our children's phones at all.","Account Sign-in, Browser Compatibility, Device Connectivity, Download and Installation, Remote Control Functionality",Negative
"Samsung device, Samsung app, Pixel phone. Does everything have to be Samsung for this POS to work? I haven't been able to control the TV with this app since I installed it 2 phones ago. The routines work for turning the TV on and off, which is why I give two stars. But if I misplace my physical remote, the app thinks the TV is off when it's on. So hey, I thought. Let's delete the device from the app and add it back. Maybe that will do it. But if there's a way to do that, I can't find it.","Device Control, Routine Building, Device Status Updates, App Compatibility, Device Removal/Re-addition",Both Positive and Negative
"Works great Ã°ÂÂÂ I use it because I run two Samsung TVs side by side and I often need to control them separately, but they have the same remote codes... So if you use this app for one of them it goes through the wireless connection as opposed to using the IR blaster like most remote controls do. So, I simply put a piece of black tape over the IR receiver on the TV I wanted to control via this app, and now I have one that responds only to the stock remote and one that operates through this app!Ã°ÂÂÂ°","Wireless Connection, Multi-Device Control, IR Blaster Alternative",Positive
"This app is incredibly convoluted and unintuitive. You have to create an account, register the TV to your account, navigate a bunch of menus that are slow to load, and still have a hard time finding what you want on it. A horrible experience if you just want to cast some photos to a friends TV. I was trying to cast/mirror my cellphone to the TV and couldn't after almost 30 mins. What a waste to have a ""smart TV"" that can't do simple stuff that used to work flawlessly with android cast.","User Account Creation, Device Registration, Menu Navigation, Content Discovery, Casting/Mirroring, Compatibility, Ease of Use",Positive
"The most recent update made the TV remote layout clunky & weird. I like the prior layout MUCH better. Why change it to this? UPDATE: Dropped rating even further. I just realized they also removed the function ""Play TV Sound on Phone"". It seems it's because it wasn't being used enough. However I've read a lot of frustrated complaints about this on message boards. You guys need to bring that back.","TV Remote Layout, Play TV Sound on Phone Feature",Both Positive and Negative
"Samsung keeps updating things in such a way that pushes people towards using this app, but it's AWFUL. Too much going on, yet none of the feature people actually want and is a pain to use. Returning a samsung tv and thinking about switching to another provider. Got the tv and you literally can't even cast. They say you can cast to the tv using the app, but you can't! It only MIRRORS your phone, which is not actually casting. This also makes it so that you can't cast other items, like an occlus.","Casting Capability, User Interface, Ease of Use, Mirroring Feature, Compatibility",Negative
"This app only works with my Samsung Q900TS about 30% of the time. Work around is connecting it directly to TV with 4k cable or restarting my router. For whatever reason, this model TV pulls 2 IP addresses (wifi 5 and wifi 6) and it will not let me disable one on the TV. Tried all sorts of settings in the router, but nothing works. Static IP, MAC stuff. I finally gave up and just bought a cable to hardwire it. If I reboot the router and toggle wifi on/off on the tablet, then it all syncs up.","Connectivity, Compatibility, Wi-Fi Connectivity, Device Control, Router Configuration, IP Address Management, Static IP, MAC Address Configuration",Both Positive and Negative
"UPDATE: Reached out to service and they were no help. Sent screenshots, logs, and all requested details and nothing back from them twice. ORIGINAL: The Samsung TV remote is absolutely terrible. For one, it takes way too many clicks to get to it. Just give me a remote widget or a one click option. Also, once the remote opens, it constantly just takes me to some permissions like webpage asking ""Applicable service: SmartThings TV Plugin"". All, I want to do is fast forward on my tv.","Remote Control, User Interface, Permission Management, Customer Support",Positive
latest update prevents me from uploading photos to my Frame TV. If someone could give me instructions on how to make it work that would be great. I keep getting the same error message that there is a network connectivity error and to refresh but every workaround and hack I've tried to date fails. maybe don't update your app before testing all the features to ensure they actually work. I did what you said and now I can't even log into my account now. The button doesn't work.,"Network Connectivity, Login Functionality, Photo Upload, App Update Testing",Negative
"I used to rate this a 5 star app, but since the update the remote add-on for my Samsung TV & ever since then, it looks great but the functionality is terrible. I can barely use it & since I lost my remote, I basically can't use my TV now. Moving the cursor now when trying to navigate a webpage is virtually impossible. Before I could use the phone screen like a laptop touch pad, but now trying to use that feature creates all sorts of directional errors. up down left right doesn't work righteither","Remote Control Functionality, Cursor Movement, Touchpad Feature, Directional Navigation",Positive
"Absolute garbage. I installed it on my Google Pixel phone to set up my Samsung TV. First, I had issues creating a sign in with my Google account. Then after finding many other people with the same issue, found a way to resolve that. Now I use a password to sign in...but the app will not let me sign in at all still! I've tried everything you can think of, and have now given up and will never buy Samsung again, especially after seeing how many other people have had the exact same issues.","Compatibility, Account Sign-in, App Reliability",Positive
"This app is functional, until my frame tv is offline (due to an issue with the tv or app , who knows). I have to confirm that I give permission for my phone to run a diagnostic to repair the issue despite having already given it permission to access my tv, and I now can't connect to select OK on the tv...hence the need for a diagnostic! This didn't happen in the previous version and I could actually get my tv back online. If my dog hadn't eaten the tv remote I wouldn't be using this app.","Device Connection, Permission Management, Diagnostic and Repair, User Interface, Device Control",Positive
"Omg i hate this app! I have a samsung TV that I bought and an LG TV that was gifted to us, and the difference is insane! My Samsung TV is SO laggy and then if I forget the TV on and want to use the smart things app to turn it off from bed, since I don't use the app often it wants me to manually set it up on the TV defeating the convenience of the app! My LG never lags, and i sign in, and it connects to my TV from my account, and the worst-case scenario is I have to log in on the app again.","Device Compatibility, Performance, Ease of Use, Connectivity",Negative
"the Samsung trying to be everything is not very handy, especially for people who don't have the most recent products. Nothing has hooked up. I have an older TV and I can't even use parts of YouTube or Hulu. I don't really like anything that Samsung has tried in place of my Google account on my phone. In fact, it interferes. even the keyboard and the talk to text, saving passwords, personal prefs I'd rather just use my Google account but you know what I'll take that over Apple ANYTHING","Compatibility, Integration with Google Account, Voice Assistant, Keyboard and Text-to-Speech, Password Saving, Personal Preferences, Device Connectivity, App Compatibility",Negative
Unless you want Samsung to know everything about you this doesn't work. Just makes you create a Samsung account you didn't want. In my case even giving them this it still doesn't work because they are trying to set up 2 factor verification with an old phone I don't have. All I want to do is cast my non Samsung phone to the expensive Samsung monitor that's supposed to do everything. I really hate Samsung limiting everything by being awkward. Thier arrogance is unreal,"Account Creation, Two-Factor Verification, Device Compatibility, Casting Capability",Negative
"As a result of the most recent update the virtual touchpad of the TV remote has become unusable because it is oversensitive. This means that I start to swipe in order to select an item on the TV and I don't even get to the icon I wanted to, because the touchpad overreacts and opens another icon that I was just moving over. The issue is really frustrating. Also a suggested reset of the TV did not solve anything...","Touchpad Sensitivity, TV Remote Control",Negative
"Update: I finally bought a Samsung TV, the app works great. A nice app, if you have other things to use it with. I do not, so it is vexing that I cannot get this eternally enabled & updating app off of my phone. In the last 2 years many of the Samsung branded apps are auto installed, and cannot be disabled regardless of the user having no need of it. Samsung has great products- you don't need to force us to like them. We will buy them when we want to. Don't be Apple, guys.","Uninstallation/Disable Feature, Compatibility, Forced Installation",Positive
"Mirror cast not an option in my standard Smart Things app. No way to cast to my Samsung TV I use a Samsung A14 phone, a Samsung A8 tablet and a 2 year old Samsung 50' TV. My tablet has Smart View installed (not Smart Things) and I can mirror to my TV. On the phone no Smart View but Smart Things. I was under the impression that it had Smart View ( it does) and I can connect my TV to the app/phone and I can bring up Smart View in the app, BUT NO MIRRORING in the drop down. Why? What's wrong?","Screen Mirroring, Smart View, Device Connectivity, App Compatibility",Positive
"Very dissatisfied with how this app works with The Frame TV. There is no way to organize the gallery of photos you upload, and it's a miracle if the app even works, as it often throws general and unsearchable error messages when trying to upload photos to Art Mode. I am ASTOUNDED that there is no gallery view setting for the frame, when there is one for my other 60in Samsung Smart TV which can auto arrange a selection of my photos. Where is this feature for my ART TV?","Gallery Organization, Error Handling, Gallery View Setting, Auto Arrange Feature, Upload Functionality",Positive
"Lost features after update! Use the app solely to add personal photos to Samsung frame TV. It used to allow you to add multiple portrait photos to a single frame, mounted on a mat (choose the style around the photos). This feature has just been silently removed so the TV is less useful than before. You also used to be able to adjust the autocrop so it didn't just crop the centre when setting an image and also favourite images. Not a fan of features just disappearing making the experience worse","Photo Editing, Autocrop, Favourite Images, Multi-Photo Frame, Mat Style Customization",Negative
"App barely ever loads. Stays on the full screen icon view. This is disgusting. Why do I need an account or even an active Internet connection to control my tv? If your net drops for any reason, you can't go watch anything while you wait, or even change input to a console. I suggest if you don't own a Samsung TV that you NEVER buy one. It won't be yours. It's gotten to the point I gotta re-login multiple times while changing the volume!","App Loading, Internet Connection Requirement, Account Requirement, Device Control, Volume Control",Negative
"The double tap return feature for TV remotes for which this app was getting 5 stars have now been removed via a software update. One by one, all good features are being removed. This is what happens when companies run out of ideas that they will take away what you have paid for and will sell the same thing again in their next years flagship, excluding it's last years customers. People should file lawsuits against these types of business practices. Dont buy products of this company and get fooled","Double Tap Return Feature, Software Update, Compatibility, Customer Support",Both Positive and Negative
Impossible to turn off haptic feedback vibration whilst controlling the TV (Q90T) or anything from the app. Totally puts me off using the app at all. Bit of a shame. No need to vibrate for putting the volume up and down or doing anything. Surely extremely easy to implement. Haven't come across the issue in any app ever before to be honest in terms of not just following your system settings of which I have off. OnePlus6t here but seems to be even be Samsung phone to.,"Haptic Feedback, System Settings Integration, Volume Control, App Usability",Positive
"I've been using the app as a TV remote controller and it worked perfectly until latest change in TV remote. Now I cannot control the volume, change the channel and navigation is poorly managed. Don't know why you changed it but it needs a do over. As a suggestion, put on the TV remote all the buttons there are on the Samsung smart TV remote: power, 123, volume, channel, mute, TV guide, arrows, OK and the apps.","TV Remote Control, Volume Control, Channel Control, Navigation, Button Layout",Positive
"Lost my tv remote, ÃÂ£60 to replace or an intermittently useless app? This'll do. If more than one person is to use the app you need to BOTH create a Samsung account to operate the app simultaneously, otherwise it doesn't work on one device. This is a faff, but fixable. Smart TV apps like amazon prime intermittently stop working also, which is irritating, but resetting the TV usually fixes the problem. It has great potential, but a few intermittent faults bring it down. Still a staple app","Multi-User Support, App Reliability, Compatibility with Smart TV Apps, Resetting/Rebooting Capability, Shared Control",Negative
"First, and the most important thing is... BRING BACK THE ""PLAY TV SOUND ON PHONE"" FEATURE. Or if it is still exist, please let us know how to use it. Second, the UI UX for ""TV Remote"" control is quite annoying. Please make all the buttons there have to be tapped until our finger releases first before the function is executed. Because often I press a button that I don't want, and my finger hasn't left the screen, but the function has been executed. That's so annoying.","TV Sound Playback, TV Remote Control, Button Activation Mechanism",Negative
"I had an old tv with a cheap wifi IR remote, and the experience was so much smoother than controlling my Samsung smart tv from my Samsung phone. Most Bixby actions don't work (turn on tv, raise volume, mute/unmute...) claiming tv is offline, or similar errors. Getting to the app remote takes several taps, with loading times in between, making it much less convenient than using the physical remote. Expectation: 1) Tap on tv icon on home screen 2) Remote is shown. Bonus: controls work reliably...","Remote Control, Ease of Use, Reliability, Device Connectivity",Positive
"Awful. Cannot connect a SAMSUNG TV to a SAMSUNG Tablet for screen sharing. (The remote control works, though). The problem was solved after I spent more than 1h with support. None of the solutions worked, until they gave me the ""nuclear option"": hard reset the tablet and lose all my apps' settings.I had to try three times to pair the TV, then, when it finally did, it started to act weird, with missing apps and stuff. Then I had to try twice to actually mirror the screen. Samsung, never again. 0*","Screen Sharing, Device Connectivity, Remote Control, App Settings Management, Device Pairing, Screen Mirroring",Negative
"Latest update broke many functions of the screen mirroring feature. Eg it crashes and loses connection to the TV, often crashing other apps with it. Watching a free and legal streaming app (Tubi) loses connection to the TV if you so much as breathe at the phone screen. Perfect Player also crashes leaving audio on without video (and without any app apparently running on the phone). Forget about streaming video using this app from now on, it's buggy and laggy (lags on TV but not on the phone) etc.","Screen Mirroring, Stability, Connectivity, Video Streaming, App Compatibility",Negative
"Overall a great app to control my Samsung TV. The app is seamlessly working as a standalone app replacing physical remote.  However following are few issues/improvement suggestion.  1. Bixby is quite primative stage, cant recognize indian accent. Always the voice is misread.  2. Voice integration to Amazon Alexa, Google assistant are sloppy. Smartthings cannot be integrated Amazon Alexa for india region. So no control possible from Amazon devices/Alexa for India region.  Google assistant commands are restricted to TV power on/off, mute/unmute and volume increase/decrease. It does not allow to change channel, open apps, not change input sources.","Voice Recognition, Integration with Amazon Alexa, Integration with Google Assistant, Channel Changing, App Opening, Input Source Changing, Regional Compatibility, Accent Recognition",Negative
"Buggy, laggy and a really poor UI (2020 q series smart tv). *Edit* Today it took 6 minutes for the app to find a tv, on the same wifi network, both already turned on. The tv was greyed out and it was way quicker to get up and find the remote. After sort of working for a few months now it's asking to download something to let me connect to the tv and the download fails every time. Absolute P.o.s.","Device Connection, User Interface, Download/Installation, App Performance",Negative
My Samsung qled tv's are now showing as offline with an icon of a cloud with a line through them. i have tried installing the app and reinstalling but the problem still exists. it was fine until the last update.  Update: This may help other people.  I got in touch with Samsung and they suggested. We request you to turn on the TV and make sure your mobile is within the range to tv and now check whether the tv showing still offline with cloud icon or as online. (This did not work.)  So...

"NÃÂ£o funciona com Alexa. Hi thanks for the support. So the problem is Samsung tv doesn't allow other assistant to control smart functions. Alexa with smart things should do it but even though, can only turn on or off the tv. Doesn't connect Bluetooth with tv. Doesn't open any app. It's SchrÃÂ¶dinger's connection.

"I have a Samsung tablet on Android 10 & it works. However, since the latest Android 11 update on my phone. I can only see my 2 Samsung TV's. I can no longer see the other TV's in the house that use a Chromecast. I have tried deleting cache. Re-installing the app. With no luck. When I go through Google home to connect to the Chromecast.

"This app is the only way I can use my TVs without using the controls on the actual TV since I have 2 Samsung televisions relatively close together. It used to work most of the time ( not reliably). At this point though I am unable to use the app at all as a message comes up when I select one of the TVs that says I need to download something to 'help my experience' but when I say okay it says that the download failed and it won't let me get to the remote. Samsung, please fix this app.","Remote Control, Download/Installation, Reliability, Compatibility",Positive
Rubbish app. Most of the time it wont connect to my Samsung tv and when it does connect clicking the tile turns the tv off. When I turn tv back on the app wont connect. Pointless waste of time Edit after samsung response: tried what you have said but this has to be done each time the app is used and doesn't solve the problem. If I do manage to connect for sound to phone or screen mirror the quality is awful. This app is fundamentally flawed. Is it really worth trying over and over again? No,"Connectivity, Device Control, Screen Mirroring, Sound Quality",Negative
"No longer useable on my TV. The app never allowed me to turn the TV on (Same with GH and Alexa), all other functions worked, strangely I've managed to download a 3rd party remote that CAN turn the TV on, mimics the full remote and works quicker and easier than this one so that's a win for a free 3rd app managing better functionality than the actual manufacturers. Crazy. I'm glad I haven't invested in the ST ecosystem yet that's for sure.","Device Control, Voice Assistant Integration, Remote Control Capability, Compatibility",Positive
"L.e. it seems whenever I open the app, the Art mode settings are not available. The remote works well so I don't understand why the settings aren't working. 90% of the times I open the app my Samsung The Frame appears offline. It's exasperating. L.e. (+1 star for the good answer) removing and adding the TV back helped. But I still don't like apps where I need to re-login or re-add items.

"After apps updates, the option 'Play TV Sound on phone' is no longer available. I've bought a Samsung Smart TV primarily because of this function, to play TV sound on my Samsung phone so that the TV sound doesn't affect my family members when the TV is on. It is very disappointing that the basic function was removed after the app updates. Updates are supposed to improve users' experience and not to frustrated users by removing useful functions. Please do consider having the option again.",TV Sound Playback on Phone,Positive
"My new TV recommended that I install this, only for the app to require a Samsung account. It's onerous to have to give away permissions, and your personal data privacy, to use features that could be made available to local network users. I can't endorse this. I like Samsung generally, but it's disappointing that they don't offer a way to use smart features on devices that are connected to the same router without having to send (potentially private) data through their data centres.","Local Network Connectivity, Data Privacy, Account Requirements",Both Positive and Negative
"What if you can't be bothered to find the TV remote and resorted to use this app instead to escape cringe show, but SmartThings app said ""you need to download an update to use your phone as a remote"".

"Very poor working with older model tv even though it is a 4k tv, but maybe they want me to buy a TV like a mobile phone every two years a new one.. Older app was much better with a lot more functionality even with older models, this one keeps telling my tv is off even when it is on and sometimes it works just fine.

"I have a Samsung Q7FN TV and this app is required to utilise the full features of Ambient mode, trouble is it doesn't work - try to upload your own photos and it almost always says can't connect to server, try again later.

"Cannot upload photos from phone to frame tv. App tells me to make sure the phone and tv are on the same network (they are). Rebooted, uninstalled/reinstalled, and still nothing. The whole point of the frame tv is to be able to display photos of art when tv not in use. Had done this previously, but was able to resolve. Now doing it again. Clearly a bug needs fixing.

"NOT a solution for smart phone casting / screen share issues. The ""Smart TV"" suggested this app as a way to solve problems with native casting / screen sharing. But, this app is a waste of time and designed by Samsung to collect personal information, requiring the user to create an account before the app connects.

On my previous phone (Note 8) it worked fine initially, that was over a year ago (with my 2018 Samsung Q8FN TV)..but then a few months in, it started to act up.

"Mirroring to the TV never connects, although the TV mirrors to my phone. I was able to solve the issue allowing permissions in the ""Media and Devices"" app. I had no help finding the solution. The mirroring is very decent. I give 3 stars for now. The remote control is supposed to have a black theme since most Samsung phones have AMOLED screens.

"Horrible. I have spent hours over the course of many days trying to sync my phone to my TV so I can cast pictures and videos. I have done several troubleshooting suggestions including: turning devices on and off, resetting the internet, and calling my internet provider, and the app has never been able to find my TV.

Worst remote. You open the app sometimes it just had the off button. And you end up pressing it by mistake turning the TV off. So you then have to turn it back on.

"Seems nice on paper but when you start grow in devices the app and the hub start getting horrible response times (1 minute or more to do anything using the app) and status updates worst - Dont show the real device status. Only 6 devices, all on/off switches, 100% Zwave, small 1 floor home no dimmer or complex stuff, the hub is in the middle of the house, Plugged in using ethernet cable, no wifi.

Finally this app seems up to standards. Don't be disappointed if you try and add an existing hub that is already setup and in use. In my experience this app kept reporting an error when I inputed my hub code trying to add my Smartthings hub but several days later this app went ahead and self populated with all of my devices and settings!

Big light off, TV light at 20%, bed light at 5% & Colour changing LEDs on rear of TV on. We swap between options 1& 2 during the night, so a toggle would be perfect.

"If it worked correctly all of the time it would be good, but it does not.

"Finally made the transition from smartthings classic to the newest version. I had to recreate some of my routines, but on the plus side the new app gives more powerful options which meant I could consolidate some routines and remove others altogether. The interface is lovely and the app is a pleasure to use. There are frequent updates and I can't wait to see what the team do next.

"Works OK with smart switches. A bit tricky to set up a routine to turn the lights on & off when I'm away - the help doesn't clarify the relation between 'location mode' and 'when member is home/away', and the various timing options are a bit confusing. I eventually worked out a routine to set location mode to 'away' and routines for each light on/off depending on that. Not intuitive.

Used to work fine (other than a bit of laggyness here and there). But now the lag is horrendous most of the time (which it shouldn't be considering i run a +100mb connection). There is also now a new feature - vibration. Why anyone thought this was a good idea I can't imagine. I guess its not so much of an issue when using as a TV remote but when you're using it to browse the web; your phone is just constantly vibrating. Seriously irritating and pointless.,"Performance, Vibration Feature, Web Browsing Capability",Negative
"VERY DISAPPOINTED with the update. We have had our Samsung range for 4 years and the previous versions of the smartthings app has always worked very well, connecting easily within seconds and alerting me even when I am out of the house. I didn't realize that there was an update recently and so when I went on my device to preheat my oven, it told me that my range was disabled. I spent the better part of a half hour to try to get the app to reconnect, going so far as to factory reset my range and uninstall and reinstall the app to my phone and it just won't see it even if I am practically sitting on top of the range with both AP showing on the screen and my phone scanning for it. I don't understand why the update on the app deleted all my settings, but regardless of that, I should be able to at least reconnect. At this point I am very disappointed and would not recommend a product that uses this version of the app. Considering all of the recent 1 star ratings it looks like Samsung's PM or lead developers really dropped the ball here.","Connection Capability, Device Control, Notification, App Update, Settings Management, Compatibility, Ease of Use",Negative
"It works most of the time for me but does have a few bugs, particularly on the home page where I keep having to re-order things as the app resets the order every couple of days. Also, some automations, including Samsung's own SmartLight automations, sometimes just don't work. I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of some big names in smart home, such as Google and not having any native support for Nest devices. Sure they can be added by other means but that seems a bit unnecessary these days. My biggest gripe however, as others have noted, is the need to use two different versions of the app to be able to manage all my devices. That's ridiculous.","Device Management, Automation, Compatibility, App Usability, Native Support, Multi-App Management",Negative
"Fantastic app for home automation. Can't say I've had a problem with it. If you want to do more than just use light bulbs or Samsung things it requires a bit of learning.

Inclusion of more recommended automation would be great also.","Compatibility with 3rd party devices, Device Handlers, Automation Features, Hardwire Device Support, User Interface, Learning Curve",Positive
"Terrible app. I do automation for a living. The migration from the classic to this broke my entire setup. None of my routines work, it changed the settings for my security setup. I have to rebuild the entire system. The app itself is left to be desired. At least the classic app was arranged better for easier navigation and allowed you to see stuff at a quick glance. Wish I wasn't so invested into this platform or I would go another route.","Routines, Settings, Navigation, Compatibility, App Layout",Positive
"Similar as Samsung smart things hub this app is not a mature product. It's more like something built by a bunch of high school students in someone's garage just for fun. Once a while after installing some updates I have to add the hub again (it simply disappears). And it's not easy to do it. It would take hours to resetup everything when you have many controlled by the hub. One good thing, it doesn't burn itself like the Note 7. My Samsung smartthings hub was disappear from the app twice in a single day. I just added back this morning after it disappeared the 2nd time in a couple weeks. And I found it was missing again in the evening. This app and Samsung smartthings hub are really piece of junk. Think it over before you buy.

"Very well designed app, simple to use and everything is laid out in a say that's easy to understand and find everything you need. Like that you can have different houses, rooms and automations!

"The design of the new app is massively improved, but at the cost of responsiveness Ã¢ÂÂ it is now painfully slow to use to the point that I tap something multiple times and only a few seconds leter those actions register. It's the only app that runs so slow on my Moto Z (Android 8.0).

I'll stick with the Classic app.","Responsiveness, Smart Home Monitor, SMS Alerts, Functionality",Negative
"I still have the classic app but switched over to the new app. I have about 30 z-wave devices (light switches, motion detection, plugs, harmony, alexa, speakers), bad move on my part. Some things work, device history is not one of them. On some devices some history comes in but is about a day later. Checking the old classic app the history is there and updates instantly.
