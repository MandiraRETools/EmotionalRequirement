"Trying to get away from cloud-based automation, I installed home assistant on my Synology server, as well as the integration local Tuya. Everything is functioning perfectly. So, I downloaded this app, to control using my phone. The app works well, and it's nicely laid out. However, one star off because widgets are a problem. In essence, when I tap a widget, it does what I want it to do, but then it is replaced by an endlessly spinning arrow. Fix: I have to delete the widget.",trying get away cloudbased automation installed home assistant synology server well integration local tuya everything functioning perfectly downloaded app control using phone app work well nicely laid however one star widget problem essence tap widget want replaced endlessly spinning arrow fix delete widget,0
"App is great and would have been 5 stars, but the recent update that added Android 11 power menu buttons changed how location is reported. It would always regularly turn on the GPS to get a position, but it was always very brief. Just a flash. Now it keeps GPS on for a minute or longer every time I unlock my phone. It seems to be tied to power menu controls. If I remove all Home Assistant controls it reverts the old behavior. I was using only lights and scenes as power menu tiles.",app great would 5 star recent update added android 11 power menu button changed location reported would always regularly turn gps get position always brief flash keep gps minute longer every time unlock phone seems tied power menu control remove home assistant control reverts old behavior using light scene power menu tile,0
"Dark theme sucks. The app is great overall, but the app is suck always in dark theme which makes the text on my picture cards white, to contrast with the normally black background, but the picture is white, so you can't see the text at all.

"While the app by itself works fine, the latest update is a bit ""temperamental"". I notice that it looses connection a lot, even when I'm on the same network as my Home Assistant is, and suddenly the Battery and WiFi sensors disappeared. I hope truly that this can be fixed, because I think it is a great addition to Home Assistant. Specifically the fact, that it updates location. Please keep up the good work!

The main server app is great but this phone app is not. Been requesting support for multiple servers/homes for years and am baffled why it is still missing.

Something changed around November 2023. App performance is terrible. The interface is now so slow that it takes seconds to even scroll down a page.
