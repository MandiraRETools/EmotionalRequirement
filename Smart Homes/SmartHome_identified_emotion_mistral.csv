Relevant examples of past user feedback:

* Review: Easy to set up and connecting new devices how ever with window and door alarms, motion detection there is a delay on the notification sent to my phone, I had to actually open up the application after being in the house for approx 3minutes and still waited a few seconds before the alarm notification sounded. What would have happened if this was the carbon monoxide or fire alarm Ã°ÂÂ¤Â I'd hate to wonder. Was looking to buy more equipment for around the rest of the house but I'll think I will wait until this issue is fixed. Also needs the option to allow it's own notification sound or tone.

Emotion: Negative

This review highlights the potential frustration of users with the delay in notification and the lack of customization options. The integration of security cameras and motion sensors should address these concerns by providing real-time alerts and customizable notification options.

* Review: I have a simple setup: turn camera on when I leave the house, turn it off when I came back. And yet every day when I come back home, I get a ""person seen"" alert, and I have to open the app for the system to realize ""oh, I'm home"" and turn off the camera. I don't get it. The phone knows its current location, it's on the home wifi, how hard is it to check either of these *before* sending me an alert? (and yes, I have checked the app permissions and the settings). Anyway. [edit] it's still broken

Emotion: Negative
