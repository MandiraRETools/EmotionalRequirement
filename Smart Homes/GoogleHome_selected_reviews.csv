"Need to add the ability to say ""snooze"" for alarms on the Google Nest Hubs. Also, the Home app would be GREATLY improved if it placed a box around faces that the camera sees. I constantly get alerts for a familiar face in my garage, even though there is absolutely no person or animal in the garage. So I have no idea what the camera thinks is a person. Lastly, the Home app tends to freeze for 5 to 20 seconds when viewing the live camera feed on wifi or broadband connections with full signal.",need add ability say snooze alarm google nest hub also home app would greatly improved placed box around face camera see constantly get alert familiar face garage even though absolutely person animal garage idea camera think person lastly home app tends freeze 5 20 second viewing live camera feed wifi broadband connection full signal,0
"Overall it works, but there are some very poor design choices. For example, creating an automation for my govee lights only allows me to pick a set of pre-chosen light colors that map extremely poorly to the actual lights' colors, and there's no way to test what they look like without saving the automation, exiting, and playing it. But choosing a color for the lights outside of the automation screen offers a full color wheel that maps much more closely to the actual light colors.",overall work poor design choice example creating automation govee light allows pick set prechosen light color map extremely poorly actual light color there way test look like without saving automation exiting playing choosing color light outside automation screen offer full color wheel map much closely actual light color,0

"Somehow the integration with Philips Hue bulbs (one of the main reasons that I got Google Home/Nest/Hub devices) has completely gone downhill over the past few years. It used to work seamlessly, then started to disconnect for minutes to hours at a time, and now they've completely stopped working for about two weeks. Many other users have reported the same issue online—can we get a fix Google, and fast?

"It tries to be so many things but little to nothing well. Faulty UI sprinkled throughout. Also, if you have older Nest cams, the Home app is not for you unless you don't want any interactive features. However, if you dont want features, then, yes, you want Home. Feedback: Google should here interns to sift thru all the comments instead of having customers go to a form and do the work for Google. Finally, make the camera viewing have a 15 second skip feature.

Setting up a Google nest router is extremely complicated. It's much easier to do on a computer and you have to use the app with these devices. If you had it set up on one phone you get a new phone afterwards. The Google home app doesn't always add the old home information or you have to set up completely and wipe the router in order to set it up on the new phone. It is a huge hassle and not recommended. Avoid Google nest products at all costs. The free device is just too costly to use,setting google nest router extremely complicated much easier computer use app device set one phone get new phone afterwards google home app doesnt always add old home information set completely wipe router order set new phone huge hassle recommended avoid google nest product cost free device costly use,0
"Devs cant Remove Local Devices?bull. Basic functionality that was around like 7 years ago, like sending a text message through voice has become non-existent.

The time and weather became ridiculously small! Why would you guys change what was essentially one of the best features of the Chromecast? Not user friendly and extremely ageist and discriminatory.

"Useless app for wifi management. Cannot even do the simplest of tasks. Wish I had not purchased. Edit: stating you are looking for ways to improve is an insincere gesture. Linking to a useless article is a thought-terminating cliché. Basic router settings like renaming 2.4 and 5 GHz with separate SSIDs should not become inaccessible after an update.

4 years after my first 1 star review and basic features are still missing that the old Nest app had. Scrubbing through video is painfully slow. No way to simply jump in small increments. Audio only plays through ear speaker instead of main speaker. Continuous recording advertised for some cameras (i.e. battery cameras connected to solar) but doesn't actually work even with valid subscription. Other users constantly get randomly removed from the home and need to get re-added. The list goes on.,4 year first 1 star review basic feature still missing old nest app scrubbing video painfully slow way simply jump small increment audio play ear speaker instead main speaker continuous recording advertised camera ie battery camera connected solar doesnt actually work even valid subscription user constantly get randomly removed home need get readded list go,0

"This app has been around for years and when it comes to video camera feed editing it's horrible. Wireless cameras are limited to only 3 minutes. The part that is stupid is that once a clip is recorded, you can't delete it. You can't delete any individual clips, you either keep all the video clips untill they expire or delete all of them. Also, when a wireless camera is unmounted from the magnetic mount, all the video history is gone untill it's remounted.

"Pretty bad. Basic functionality lacking. For lights, you can't use a color picker but need to select from a few predefined colors, half of which don't work depending on your light (even though the light supports the color, they must be calling it via a stupid name rather than RGB code).

The functionality of the app is significantly degraded while using a VPN. Integrating smart home devices is very straight forward. Unless it's a nest device. Which makes zero sense since Google owns it. Obviously keep the parent app for your smart home devices installed because the Home app only provides the basic control over your devices. Routines are helpful to an extent.

"YET ANOTHER UNTESTED APP 😡😡😡😡, hangs on forever trying to sign-into Chromecast, without telling (or DOING) ANYTHING at all (that the ""Chromecast device needs to update the Android version / firmware, updating it now so wait, etc etc""...

"Hi, I am contacting you to report a bug with the LG WK7 speaker. It completely stopped working from one day to the next. The speaker is on, but Google Home can't find it, nor is the Bluetooth function active. I reset the WK7 multiple times and tried with a old Google Home app, the result is the same, after the WK7 finishes to boot it is invisible to Home. It has turned into a brick. Many people from around the world are experiencing this. Open a bug ticket and escalate to dev team please.",hi contacting report bug lg wk7 speaker completely stopped working one day next speaker google home cant find bluetooth function active reset wk7 multiple time tried old google home app result wk7 finish boot invisible home turned brick many people around world experiencing open bug ticket escalate dev team please,1
"Won't link to my google TV??? I tried to link the 2024 Hisense Google OS TV (MN:55U7N) via my phone, as it suggested in the tv setup that this would be faster. I set it up on the TV in half the time I waited for the linking. Won't play grouped audio devices even though that's what groups are for??? Terrible accessibilty. Slow performance. How is this made by one of the biggest tech companies on the planet? Embarrassing... I can't wait for the next update where they make it miraculously worse.",wont link google tv tried link 2024 hisense google o tv mn55u7n via phone suggested tv setup would faster set tv half time waited linking wont play grouped audio device even though thats group terrible accessibilty slow performance made one biggest tech company planet embarrassing cant wait next update make miraculously worse,1
"3/2025: Camera playback is suddenly AWFUL and hasn't improved for weeks. I pay for this service and it doesn't work at all. If I try to review video footage (that again, I PAY FOR) all I get is a constantly spinning load screen and no effing footage. I'm fed up. 11/2024: Just stopping by to note that this service (that I still stupidly pay for) continues to be completely dysfunctional with no improvements in sight. 5-10 reloads to view camera footage is insane. -100/5 stars",32025 camera playback suddenly awful hasnt improved week pay service doesnt work try review video footage pay get constantly spinning load screen effing footage im fed 112024 stopping note service still stupidly pay continues completely dysfunctional improvement sight 510 reloads view camera footage insane 1005 star,1
"Just discovered that the media button has been removed and the ability to easily tick the device or multiple devices you want to cast to is no longer accessible :( Now it is so much more challenging to add casting to a second speaker via the Home app when music is already playing. You seem to have to stop it and start again via the Home app, or go and request casting to a group via the Google home mini. Downgraded my app to version 2.48.75 to get this simple app functionality back.",discovered medium button removed ability easily tick device multiple device want cast longer accessible much challenging add casting second speaker via home app music already playing seem stop start via home app go request casting group via google home mini downgraded app version 24875 get simple app functionality back,1
