"The latest update ruined the remote control feature. The pause, FF, rewind options are gone, so it's basically useless. Using the app to control the TV was so much better than the almost buttonless tiny remote that came with the TV, but now I'm forced to deal with that little remote. Please go back to the way the remote was in the app. Or at least add back the ability to do more than adjust the volume or change the channel.",latest update ruined remote control feature pause ff rewind option gone basically useless using app control tv much better almost buttonless tiny remote came tv im forced deal little remote please go back way remote app least add back ability adjust volume change channel,3
"Garbage app. Installed for a TV purchase. Love the TV hate the bloaty useless pre installed apps and lack of Google compatibility... same with this app. It is about as helpful as soggy toilet paper.

"I always come back to leave one star reviews because I think this app is that bad. Never works well. Constantly can't even connect to my tv then I have to unplug my tv. I try using smart things when I can't find my remote to turn my tv on but the app tells me to find the remote to turn the tv on, literally.

"This app stopped powering on our 75"" Samsung Frame a few updates ago. I can still power on our older 82"" Samsung and control the stove and dishwasher. I've deleted the phone and re-added, even got a new phone, an s24 Ultra, since this started. Everything else works it's just the power button that doesn't.

"Trying to use this app with my new Frame TV but every time I open the app, it takes several minutes to load and it forces me to re-cancel permissions I've opted out of.

"What an incredibly frustrating user experience. I keep trying to get the TV to use a soundbar but the output setting automatically reverts itself. Also this app opens the Samsung login page every freaking 5 seconds. The TV and the sound bar are connected with an HDMI eARC cable. There's nothing wrong with my setup but this app is extremely unintuitive, and keeps changing things away from the way it's supposed to work which is in theory actually very simple.

"This remote is every regret that I have about buying a Samsung over a Hisense roku TV. We can't ever keep track of a remote, so it was inevitable we would download this. It constantly wants us to sign into our Samsung account. Then it says that it won't work with my browser. Then I try to open it with another browser and I get stuck in a loop. Sometimes a message will appear on the TV but the remote won't connect to get rid of it. It won't even download onto our children's phones at all.",remote every regret buying samsung hisense roku tv cant ever keep track remote inevitable would download constantly want u sign samsung account say wont work browser try open another browser get stuck loop sometimes message appear tv remote wont connect get rid wont even download onto childrens phone,3
"Samsung device, Samsung app, Pixel phone. Does everything have to be Samsung for this POS to work? I haven't been able to control the TV with this app since I installed it 2 phones ago. The routines work for turning the TV on and off, which is why I give two stars. But if I misplace my physical remote, the app thinks the TV is off when it's on. So hey, I thought.

"Works great üòÉ I use it because I run two Samsung TVs side by side and I often need to control them separately, but they have the same remote codes... So if you use this app for one of them it goes through the wireless connection as opposed to using the IR blaster like most remote controls do. So, I simply put a piece of black tape over the IR receiver on the TV I wanted to control via this app, and now I have one that responds only to the stock remote and one that operates through this app!üç∞",work great use run two samsung tv side side often need control separately remote code use app one go wireless connection opposed using ir blaster like remote control simply put piece black tape ir receiver tv wanted control via app one responds stock remote one operates app,3
"This app is incredibly convoluted and unintuitive. You have to create an account, register the TV to your account, navigate a bunch of menus that are slow to load, and still have a hard time finding what you want on it. A horrible experience if you just want to cast some photos to a friends TV. I was trying to cast/mirror my cellphone to the TV and couldn't after almost 30 mins.

"The most recent update made the TV remote layout clunky & weird. I like the prior layout MUCH better. Why change it to this? UPDATE: Dropped rating even further.

"Samsung keeps updating things in such a way that pushes people towards using this app, but it's AWFUL. Too much going on, yet none of the feature people actually want and is a pain to use. Returning a samsung tv and thinking about switching to another provider. Got the tv and you literally can't even cast. They say you can cast to the tv using the app, but you can't! It only MIRRORS your phone, which is not actually casting.

"This app only works with my Samsung Q900TS about 30% of the time. Work around is connecting it directly to TV with 4k cable or restarting my router.

But now instead of easy to understand comparison in one overview there is now so much reading and clicking. Have to go back and forth to see settings can't be combined.

"I don't know what Samsung was thinking. They discontinued the Classic App which was stable, intuitiave, and feature rich, and replaced it with this monostrisity that is worse. For example, why can't I see my phones as presence detectors with the new app? I lost my routines. Also, in the old app, I was able to change my Schaluge Door Codes. I can't do that any more. What was the benefit of moving away from the classic app with an app that is more confusing, and has less features?

We have had our Samsung range for 4 years and the previous versions of the smartthings app has always worked very well, connecting easily within seconds and alerting me even when I am out of the house. I didn't realize that there was an update recently and so when I went on my device to preheat my oven, it told me that my range was disabled.

I don't understand why the update on the app deleted all my settings, but regardless of that, I should be able to at least reconnect.

I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of some big names in smart home, such as Google and not having any native support for Nest devices.

It wastes energy and isn't as reliable as Wifi.,using app along n850 soundbar one bug input source change wifi dinhdmiarc without asking unplug hdmi cable fully enjoy music service one feature request going upnp soundbar able read music file stored local network wifi need use bluetooth stream music waste energy isnt reliable wifi,4
"I like having something in my drop down that lets me switch between my phone and various Bluetooth speakers. I hate that it keeps switching automatically as I walk about the house, or switching from my bedroom speakers to our living room speakers several times in one video whenever it gets a strong enough signal.",like something drop let switch phone various bluetooth speaker hate keep switching automatically walk house switching bedroom speaker living room speaker several time one video whenever get strong enough signal,4
"Does not connect to the AKG speaker. Instead of trying numerous times I have failed to get the Samsung VL350 speakers connected to wifi. The app detects speakers, validates my Samsung account, it goes up-to 39% when apparently the app is attempting to connect the speaker and I would expect next a screen to enter my Wi-Fi password. And Here it ends in error. I have tried for days now!! Resetting speaker does not help. Email to support has yielded no result, they close tickets without resolution!!",connect akg speaker instead trying numerous time failed get samsung vl350 speaker connected wifi app detects speaker validates samsung account go upto 39 apparently app attempting connect speaker would expect next screen enter wifi password end error tried day resetting speaker help email support yielded result close ticket without resolution,4
"New version sucks! Removed the function to play phone audio on TV... Even worse than that, tried to ensure that it would not be updated with a newer version until Samsung sorted this rubbish out and looks like I just got a force update...

What the hell Samsung!",new version suck removed function play phone audio tv even worse tried ensure would updated newer version samsung sorted rubbish look like got force update oh yeah really hate keep installing old version changing app setting never update getting forced updated version worse hell samsung,4
"Overall is great but since last week's update crashes continuously.

"New app seems more elegant and easier to use. But I have been having issues with my car Bluetooth connection now, Spotify has frequent interruptions when transmitting to the car.

"Have used this app on my Samsung a52 for about a year now. Only used it to change audio output device, it used to have a notification open when several devices where connected to my phone where I could easily change which device played the audio. Well in the latest updated they seemed to have removed that feature. It would also once in a while freeze my audio for a second or two making it impossible to listen to anything, had to reinstall it many times to fix it.",used app samsung a52 year used change audio output device used notification open several device connected phone could easily change device played audio well latest updated seemed removed feature would also freeze audio second two making impossible listen anything reinstall many time fix,4
"Keeps switching randomly between outputs and cutting off audio. I have a Samsung S9 phone and have now realised that what is going on is that it is switching from a cable plugged in the headphone jack to any available Bluetooth connected device irrespective of whether the device is turned on, so it switches the output to my earbuds even though they are in their charger carry case",keep switching randomly output cutting audio samsung s9 phone realised going switching cable plugged headphone jack available bluetooth connected device irrespective whether device turned switch output earbuds even though charger carry case,4
"Omg.....what total rubbish.....can't even add a paired device to a room in the settings ! The app simply doesn't allow this anywhere in settings. Update to response: Contacted support as requested and followed their advice directly. However, as I already explained, the app does not allow me to perform the function I require and support cannot solve the issue. Ironically the stock bluetooth settings on android are actually more functional, rendering this app totally pointless!
