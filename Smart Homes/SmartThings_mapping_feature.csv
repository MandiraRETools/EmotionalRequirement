"Unwanted Welcome message on TV, taking up 1/5 of my 55"" screen, overlapping my programs on several occasions when I was unable to respond because I could not find my remote, but as soon as I found my remote to click the OK checkbox at the bottom of the message, the welcome message from Smart Things has never reappeared.

"The latest update ruined the remote control feature. The pause, FF, rewind options are gone, so it's basically useless. Using the app to control the TV was so much better than the almost buttonless tiny remote that came with the TV, but now I'm forced to deal with that little remote. Please go back to the way the remote was in the app. Or at least add back the ability to do more than adjust the volume or change the channel.","Review -> Remote Control Feature, User Interface, Volume Control, Channel Control, Pause Function, Fast Forward Function, Rewind Function"
"Garbage app. Installed for a TV purchase. Love the TV hate the bloaty useless pre installed apps and lack of Google compatibility... same with this app. It is about as helpful as soggy toilet paper. More bloat and features you cannot use unless you have a Samsung garbage phone. Cannot use calibration feature which is the only thing I wanted. Pixel 9xl Pro and nope. Useful if you break or lose the garbage TV remote, if you can get through the bloated garbage.

"I always come back to leave one star reviews because I think this app is that bad. Never works well. Constantly can't even connect to my tv then I have to unplug my tv. I try using smart things when I can't find my remote to turn my tv on but the app tells me to find the remote to turn the tv on, literally. Completely defeats the purpose of the app and my buying a Samsung tv. That's a mistake I won't be making again.

"This app stopped powering on our 75"" Samsung Frame a few updates ago. I can still power on our older 82"" Samsung and control the stove and dishwasher. I've deleted the phone and re-added, even got a new phone, an s24 Ultra, since this started. Everything else works it's just the power button that doesn't. I can hit the home button on our Roku app and that will turn the Frame on. It will turn it off but not on.","Review -> Device Control, Compatibility, App Functionality"
"Trying to use this app with my new Frame TV but every time I open the app, it takes several minutes to load and it forces me to re-cancel permissions I've opted out of.

"What an incredibly frustrating user experience. I keep trying to get the TV to use a soundbar but the output setting automatically reverts itself. Also this app opens the Samsung login page every freaking 5 seconds. The TV and the sound bar are connected with an HDMI eARC cable. There's nothing wrong with my setup but this app is extremely unintuitive, and keeps changing things away from the way it's supposed to work which is in theory actually very simple.

"This remote is every regret that I have about buying a Samsung over a Hisense roku TV. We can't ever keep track of a remote, so it was inevitable we would download this. It constantly wants us to sign into our Samsung account. Then it says that it won't work with my browser. Then I try to open it with another browser and I get stuck in a loop. Sometimes a message will appear on the TV but the remote won't connect to get rid of it.

The routines work for turning the TV on and off, which is why I give two stars. But if I misplace my physical remote, the app thinks the TV is off when it's on. So hey, I thought. Let's delete the device from the app and add it back. Maybe that will do it.

"Works great ð I use it because I run two Samsung TVs side by side and I often need to control them separately, but they have the same remote codes... So if you use this app for one of them it goes through the wireless connection as opposed to using the IR blaster like most remote controls do. So, I simply put a piece of black tape over the IR receiver on the TV I wanted to control via this app, and now I have one that responds only to the stock remote and one that operates through this app!ð°","Review -> Wireless Connection, Multi-Device Control, IR Blaster Alternative"
"This app is incredibly convoluted and unintuitive. You have to create an account, register the TV to your account, navigate a bunch of menus that are slow to load, and still have a hard time finding what you want on it. A horrible experience if you just want to cast some photos to a friends TV. I was trying to cast/mirror my cellphone to the TV and couldn't after almost 30 mins.

"The most recent update made the TV remote layout clunky & weird. I like the prior layout MUCH better. Why change it to this? UPDATE: Dropped rating even further.

"Samsung keeps updating things in such a way that pushes people towards using this app, but it's AWFUL. Too much going on, yet none of the feature people actually want and is a pain to use. Returning a samsung tv and thinking about switching to another provider. Got the tv and you literally can't even cast. They say you can cast to the tv using the app, but you can't! It only MIRRORS your phone, which is not actually casting. This also makes it so that you can't cast other items, like an occlus.","Review -> Casting Capability, User Interface, Ease of Use, Mirroring Feature, Compatibility"
"This app only works with my Samsung Q900TS about 30% of the time. Work around is connecting it directly to TV with 4k cable or restarting my router. For whatever reason, this model TV pulls 2 IP addresses (wifi 5 and wifi 6) and it will not let me disable one on the TV. Tried all sorts of settings in the router, but nothing works. Static IP, MAC stuff. I finally gave up and just bought a cable to hardwire it.

"UPDATE: Reached out to service and they were no help. Sent screenshots, logs, and all requested details and nothing back from them twice. ORIGINAL: The Samsung TV remote is absolutely terrible. For one, it takes way too many clicks to get to it. Just give me a remote widget or a one click option. Also, once the remote opens, it constantly just takes me to some permissions like webpage asking ""Applicable service: SmartThings TV Plugin"".

"I used to rate this a 5 star app, but since the update the remote add-on for my Samsung TV & ever since then, it looks great but the functionality is terrible. I can barely use it & since I lost my remote, I basically can't use my TV now. Moving the cursor now when trying to navigate a webpage is virtually impossible.

Then after finding many other people with the same issue, found a way to resolve that. Now I use a password to sign in...but the app will not let me sign in at all still!

I have to confirm that I give permission for my phone to run a diagnostic to repair the issue despite having already given it permission to access my tv, and I now can't connect to select OK on the tv...hence the need for a diagnostic!

"Very dissatisfied with how this app works with The Frame TV. There is no way to organize the gallery of photos you upload, and it's a miracle if the app even works, as it often throws general and unsearchable error messages when trying to upload photos to Art Mode.

Impossible to turn off haptic feedback vibration whilst controlling the TV (Q90T) or anything from the app. Totally puts me off using the app at all. Bit of a shame.

You have to push ""show more"" and then a slide toggle to access the play/pause button. Too many pushes 3. Can't input text with a phone keyboard.

Disappointing. I just wanted to use it as a tv controller which it dose do it to a certain extent but only if the tv is already on. My device is supported and on should have this function.

Worst remote. You open the app sometimes it just had the off button. And you end up pressing it by mistake turning the TV off. So you then have to turn it back on.

"VERY DISAPPOINTED with the update. We have had our Samsung range for 4 years and the previous versions of the smartthings app has always worked very well, connecting easily within seconds and alerting me even when I am out of the house. I didn't realize that there was an update recently and so when I went on my device to preheat my oven, it told me that my range was disabled. I spent the better part of a half hour to try to get the app to reconnect, going so far as to factory reset my range and uninstall and reinstall the app to my phone and it just won't see it even if I am practically sitting on top of the range with both AP showing on the screen and my phone scanning for it. I don't understand why the update on the app deleted all my settings, but regardless of that, I should be able to at least reconnect. At this point I am very disappointed and would not recommend a product that uses this version of the app. Considering all of the recent 1 star ratings it looks like Samsung's PM or lead developers really dropped the ball here.","Review -> Connection Capability, Device Control, Notification, App Update, Settings Management, Compatibility, Ease of Use"

Also, some automations, including Samsung's own SmartLight automations, sometimes just don't work. I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of some big names in smart home, such as Google and not having any native support for Nest devices. Sure they can be added by other means but that seems a bit unnecessary these days. My biggest gripe however, as others have noted, is the need to use two different versions of the app to be able to manage all my devices.

Once a while after installing some updates I have to add the hub again (it simply disappears). And it's not easy to do it. It would take hours to resetup everything when you have many controlled by the hub. One good thing, it doesn't burn itself like the Note 7. My Samsung smartthings hub was disappear from the app twice in a single day. I just added back this morning after it disappeared the 2nd time in a couple weeks.

I can not turn my headphones off.","Review -> Device Connectivity, Volume Control, Uninstallation, Button Mapping, Voice Assistant Integration, Device Control"
"Smart Things App works fine when I first connected to my HW-Q90r soundbar. But opening the app anytime after, it will ALWAYS see Q90r as offline. So, I had to delete and re-add it as a device again. Now I can't even add it anymore: reaches 99% and then error. I successfully added it twice before - no change to router, SSID, WiFi settings since. HW-Q90r is Samsung's own flagship soundbar, app should just work without issues. If Samsung is gonna make a multi-function app, test it properly.","Review -> Device Connection, Device Status Monitoring, App Stability"
"This app is excellent for supporting my Samsung soundbar. Two things are missing. 1. The info button on the soundbar app, shows which sound codec is being played. But this function is not available on the app. Developers please consider an update to include this. The soundbar shown on the smarthings, does not function. Developers, please include this in an update","Review -> Sound Codec Information, Smart Home Device Control"
"Utterly useless. When trying to remotely program and star a washing machine, the app asked to go to the machine and manually press play. Not too clever I must say. If I need to get to the machine I would just program it manually anyway. Hopefully, it is a bug rather than a design feature. The only advantage I can think of, is the possibility of muting those terrible sounds the washing machine generates. Why there is no option to mute all sounds in its settings is beyond me.","Review -> Remote Control, Sound Control, User Interface, Automation"
"This app is good, it just lacks fluid screen mirroring even thought I have the note9, and I WISH they had private listening mode where you can hear what ever is being played on TV on your phone by headphone jack, just like they do on Roku tv, Samsung should implement that feature it would really be useful! I have a qled and note9 it should have outstanding features given that I have new devices by Samsung!!","Review -> Screen Mirroring, Private Listening Mode"
"This review would have been 5 stars, until the removal of the audio output notification panel. I loved the ability to quickly change which Bluetooth device to use. In my work I have 3 cars and 2 speakers that try to connect automatically, so to have the ability to change my audio output quickly was awesome. Please give it back to us.","Review -> Audio Output Control, Bluetooth Connectivity, Notification Panel"
Samsung can you please return the original interface to smartthings in android 9.0 where you can simply switch bluetooth playback with a single press on the notification panel. It was super useful before!!!!! The new features are cool but the interface matters way more ... too many steps with the new interface.,"Review -> User Interface, Bluetooth Playback Control"
"This was working fine until a couple of days ago. S22 Ultra and Tab 6. I Want to add my voice to those who have lost all devices. They still appear on the Web interface. Within autimations they work but show as unknown devices. I have contacted Samsung support, they don't seem to have been that aware but it has been escalated. Please Samsung the stock reply misses the part where I have already spoken to you, had a remote session and the issue has been escalated.","Review -> Device Connection, Device Control, Web Interface, Automation, Device Status Updates, Customer Support"
Main appeal for the app using earbuds is the find my buds feature for in the event I lose them. Unfortunately everytime you put the buds into the case to charge you get a left behind alerts which seems like it would be a simple thing to have programmed the app not to do. As is these alerts are annoying and interrupt me when I'm literally taking the earbuds out to talk to someone. The only option is to turn them off which kind of ruins the purpose of the app,"Review -> Find My Feature, Alert/Notification System, Charging Case Functionality"
"Nice and easy way to connect to paired devices, and switch audio outputs. I can connect to my cars hands free (ford sync), and have google maps sound through the phones speaker, and therefore car audio from it's sources, but when there's a phone call, it comes through the car speakers and system. 4 stars because i can't (as far as I know) set it to operate like that by default.","Review -> Audio Output Control, Default Connection Settings, Hands-Free Functionality"
I like how this works. It however doesn't seem to detect all files even if they are the same format Performance is quick and better than regular casting and I like the way the app interacts with Samsung Music so you can browse through your library while a song is playing to select the next track. Add to now playing queue misbehaved so be cautious of that. On the whole though I use it to play on my TV which has a 5.1 system attached so I can enjoy my phone media with the least amount of hassle.,"Review -> File Detection, Performance, App Interaction, Media Playback, Queue Management"
"Total rubbish works when it wants to. Not when you want it to. I've been through all of the instructions read them twice and not one of them dose what they say it will. I have a Samsung 50 TV it holds the connection with that, all be it reluctantly. And I have a Goodmans soundbar with bluetooth capability....... I'm supposed to be able to tap my phone or tablet on the device and it automatically connects to it. IT DOESN'T.

"Suddenly decides to not connect my HW-Q90R soundbar at all. And when I removed my soundbar to start process again, it constantly fails on ""Registration"". I've done all the troubleshooting I could and also went to the forums. But all discussions led to blind luck for some getting it to work but for the majority, not one word from Samsung. I removed my devices from this not-so-smart app and uninstalled. It shouldn't be this hard geez.","Review -> Device Connection, Registration, Ease of Use, Compatibility"
Using this app along with N850 soundbar. One bug: the input source changes from WiFi to D.IN/HDMI(ARC) without me asking for it. I have to unplug the HDMI cable to fully enjoy the Music Services. One feature request: when are you going UPNP? The soundbar is able to read music files stored on local network on the same Wi-Fi. Now I need to use Bluetooth to stream music. It wastes energy and isn't as reliable as Wifi.,"Review -> Input Source Control, WiFi Connectivity, UPNP Support, Bluetooth Connectivity, Energy Efficiency, Reliability"
"I like having something in my drop down that lets me switch between my phone and various Bluetooth speakers. I hate that it keeps switching automatically as I walk about the house, or switching from my bedroom speakers to our living room speakers several times in one video whenever it gets a strong enough signal.","Review -> Bluetooth Connectivity, Automatic Device Switching, Multi-Device Control"
"Does not connect to the AKG speaker. Instead of trying numerous times I have failed to get the Samsung VL350 speakers connected to wifi. The app detects speakers, validates my Samsung account, it goes up-to 39% when apparently the app is attempting to connect the speaker and I would expect next a screen to enter my Wi-Fi password. And Here it ends in error. I have tried for days now!! Resetting speaker does not help. Email to support has yielded no result, they close tickets without resolution!!","Review -> Wi-Fi Connectivity, Device Connection, App Functionality, Error Handling, Customer Support"
"New version sucks! Removed the function to play phone audio on TV... Even worse than that, tried to ensure that it would not be updated with a newer version until Samsung sorted this rubbish out and looks like I just got a force update... Oh yeah, I really hate it now. I keep installing an old version, changing app settings to never update, then getting forced updated to a version that is worse for me! What the hell Samsung!","Review -> Audio Playback on TV, App Update Management"
"Overall is great but since last week's update crashes continuously. I've got a second speaker (Samsung VL3) and it constantly fails to keep them both connected to the stereo mode, lasted about one week working fine. I tried everything, reseting them, reconnecting them and even uninstall the app, the app keeps crashing when connecting them to Stereo all the time now.

"New app seems more elegant and easier to use. But I have been having issues with my car Bluetooth connection now, Spotify has frequent interruptions when transmitting to the car.

"I had a hiccup a few months ago but that got fixed. Idk what's happened but the app has become really slow and I have to hold to get it to select anything, I can't just tap.. searching for things (like on YT) take 10 times longer now as their interface isn't very intuitive either. Also can't seem to find the microphone on the app any more?","Review -> Response Time, Touch Sensitivity, Search Functionality, User Interface, Microphone Accessibility"

"Have used this app on my Samsung a52 for about a year now. Only used it to change audio output device, it used to have a notification open when several devices where connected to my phone where I could easily change which device played the audio. Well in the latest updated they seemed to have removed that feature. It would also once in a while freeze my audio for a second or two making it impossible to listen to anything, had to reinstall it many times to fix it.","Review -> Audio Output Control, Notification, Stability/Performance"
"Keeps switching randomly between outputs and cutting off audio. I have a Samsung S9 phone and have now realised that what is going on is that it is switching from a cable plugged in the headphone jack to any available Bluetooth connected device irrespective of whether the device is turned on, so it switches the output to my earbuds even though they are in their charger carry case","Review -> Bluetooth Connectivity, Audio Output Management"
"Omg.....what total rubbish.....can't even add a paired device to a room in the settings ! The app simply doesn't allow this anywhere in settings. Update to response: Contacted support as requested and followed their advice directly. However, as I already explained, the app does not allow me to perform the function I require and support cannot solve the issue. Ironically the stock bluetooth settings on android are actually more functional, rendering this app totally pointless!
